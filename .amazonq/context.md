- **Processing Time**: 6 hours total
- **Success Rate**: 92.3% qualification rate
- **Quality Scores**: 9.2/10 average (Strong Hire: Myunggyo Seo 9.2/10, Minseok Kim 9.1/10)

## Architecture & Technology Stack

### Core Technology
- **Language**: Python ≥3.12
- **AI Framework**: Context-centric multi-agent system (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Amazon Q Developer)
- **Package Management**: UV package manager
- **Methodology**: ReAct (Reason → Act → Observe → Repeat)

### Production Workflow
```bash
# Complete 7-stage hiring workflow execution
python scripts/complete_workflow_final.py
```

### Key Components
1. **Context Loading** → Data normalization → JD mapping
2. **Screening** → Assignment generation → Interview kits
3. **Consolidation** → Quality validation → Results delivery

## Context Engineering Protocol

### Mandatory Behavior
Amazon Q Developer must follow this context engineering methodology:

1. **Context Collection**: Always examine `context/` directory first
2. **Artifact Verification**: Check `artifacts/` for existing outputs
3. **Information Completeness**: Verify all necessary data is available
4. **Missing Data Protocol**: Request specific missing information from user
5. **Structured Storage**: Save outputs to appropriate directories

### Verification Checklist
- [ ] Context files loaded from `context/`
- [ ] Existing artifacts reviewed from `artifacts/`
- [ ] Task requirements understood
- [ ] All necessary information available

## Company Context

### Core Values (10 Values)
1. Technical Excellence & Scalable Elegance
2. Customer-Centric Craftsmanship
3. Ownership & Proactivity
4. Observability & Guardrails
5. Data-Informed Iteration
6. Integrity & Reliability
7. Security & Compliance First
8. Collaboration & Knowledge-Sharing
9. Continuous Learning & Mentorship
10. Innovative Spirit

### Interview Framework
- **BEI (Behavioral Event Interviewing)**: STAR method validation
- **Technical Deep-Dive**: Skill assessment and red flag addressing
- **Pair Programming**: Tiered problems (easy/intermediate/expert)
- **System Design**: Customized to candidate background

## File Organization

### Artifact Management
- **Public** (`artifacts/public/`): Shareable materials and outputs
- **Private** (`artifacts/private/`): Sensitive evaluations and feedback
- **Context** (`context/`): Company information and processes
- **Structured Organization**: By date, candidate, process type

### Quality Standards
- Maintain 9.2/10+ quality scores
- Ensure 90%+ success rates
- Follow context engineering principles
- Implement comprehensive error handling
