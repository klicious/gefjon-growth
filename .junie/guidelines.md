## Context Engineering Methodology

### **Mandatory Pre-Task Protocol**
Before executing any task, you MUST follow this context engineering sequence:

1. **Context Collection** 
   - Load ALL context files from `context/*.yaml`
   - Review relevant artifacts from `artifacts/public/` and `artifacts/private/`
   - Verify company information, processes, and reference materials

2. **Information Completeness Check**
   ```
   ✓ Company mission, vision, and 10 core values loaded
   ✓ Relevant HR processes and workflows identified  
   ✓ Team structures and role requirements understood
   ✓ Candidate/employee data available (if applicable)
   ✓ Task requirements fully understood
   ```

3. **Missing Information Protocol**
   - **STOP** task execution if context is insufficient
   - **IDENTIFY** specific missing information requirements
   - **REQUEST** missing data from task provider with clear specifications
   - **WAIT** for complete information before proceeding

4. **Structured Output Storage**
   - Save all outputs to appropriate `artifacts/` subdirectories
   - Update relevant `context/` files when new information is discovered
   - Maintain structured organization and naming conventions
   - Include metadata headers in all generated files

### **Context Verification Checklist**
Before any task execution:
- [ ] All relevant context files loaded from `context/`
- [ ] Existing artifacts reviewed from `artifacts/`
- [ ] Task requirements fully understood
- [ ] Company values and processes integrated
- [ ] Output destination identified
- [ ] Quality standards confirmed

## Company Context Integration

### **Core Values (10 Values)**
You must integrate these values into all HR decisions and recommendations:

1. **Technical Excellence & Scalable Elegance**
2. **Customer-Centric Craftsmanship**
3. **Ownership & Proactivity** 
4. **Observability & Guardrails**
5. **Data-Informed Iteration**
6. **Integrity & Reliability**
7. **Security & Compliance First**
8. **Collaboration & Knowledge-Sharing**
9. **Continuous Learning & Mentorship**
10. **Innovative Spirit**

### **Interview Process Framework**
- **BEI (Behavioral Event Interviewing)**: Validate core values through STAR method
- **Technical Deep-Dive**: Assess claimed skills and address red flags  
- **Pair Programming**: Use problems from `artifacts/public/hiring/pair_programming/`
- **System Design**: Custom problems tailored to candidate background

---

## MCP Integration Requirements

### **Available MCP Servers**
You MUST leverage these MCP servers for enhanced capabilities:

**Research (Primary → Fallback): `exa` → `google-search`**
- **Exa (`exa`)**: AI-powered web searches, company research, and competitive analysis
  - Essential for comprehensive candidate background verification
  - Advanced content discovery and market insights
  - Requires API key via remote URL parameter (exaApiKey)
- **Google Search (`google-search`)**: Reliable fallback for web research
  - Web search with content extraction capabilities
  - Use when `exa` is unavailable or budget-constrained
  - Supports similar research workflows as `exa`

**Sequential Thinking (`sequential-thinking`)**
- Structured, step-by-step reasoning and planning for complex or multi-stage HR tasks
- Useful for decomposing interview workflows, performance review cycles, and automation plans

**Playwright (`playwright`)**
- Browser automation and scripted web interactions
- Useful for opening pages, clicking, filling forms, screenshots, and scraping flows when needed

**Fetch (`fetch`)**
- Direct URL fetching/HTTP download and simple scraping
- Ensure proper configuration before use

### **Research Fallback Protocol**
1. **Primary**: Attempt `exa` for comprehensive AI-powered research
2. **Fallback**: Use `google-search` if `exa` fails or is unavailable
3. **Seamless Integration**: Both tools support similar research patterns

### **Integration Pattern**
```python
# Example MCP integration pattern with research fallback
async def enhanced_candidate_analysis(candidate_data):
    # Research with fallback: Try Exa first, then Google Search
    try:
        # Primary: Use Exa for comprehensive AI-powered research
        company_insights = await exa_mcp.research_company(candidate_data.current_company)
    except (APIError, BudgetExceeded, ServiceUnavailable):
        # Fallback: Use Google Search for reliable web research
        company_insights = await google_search_mcp.search_company(candidate_data.current_company)

    # Use Sequential Thinking to plan evaluation steps
    plan = await sequential_thinking_mcp.plan_steps(
        goal="Complete candidate evaluation end-to-end",
        context={"role": candidate_data.role, "experience": candidate_data.experience}
    )

    # Optionally use Playwright for web-based validation tasks (e.g., portfolio review)
    # page = await playwright_mcp.open_page(candidate_data.portfolio_url)
    # screenshot = await playwright_mcp.screenshot()

    # Optionally use Fetch to retrieve raw assets or JSON endpoints
    # resume_pdf = await fetch_mcp.get(url=candidate_data.resume_url)

    return comprehensive_assessment(candidate_data, plan, company_insights)
```

## Workflow Patterns & Methodologies

### **ReAct Methodology (Reason → Act → Observe → Repeat)**
All tasks must follow this cognitive pattern:

**Reason**: Analyze the situation, requirements, and available context
**Act**: Execute specific actions based on reasoning
**Observe**: Review results and outcomes of actions
**Repeat**: Iterate until task completion criteria met

### **Primary Workflow Commands**

**For Hiring Pipeline:**
```bash
# Generate complete interview kit
gemini run \
  --prompt "ai_docs/prompts/hiring/generate_interview_kit_prompt.md" \
  --context "data/public/hiring/resume/[candidate_file].json"
```

**For Performance Evaluation:**
```bash  
# Generate performance review materials
gemini run \
  --prompt "ai_docs/prompts/performance/generate_review_kit.md" \
  --context "context/teams/[team_context].yaml"
```

### **Output Structure Standards**
For each candidate/employee, create structured directories:

**Hiring Materials:**
```
artifacts/public/hiring/interview_materials/upcoming/{candidate_id}/
├── candidate_context.md      # Executive briefing with core value alignment
├── interview_guide.md        # Detailed interview plan with personalized questions
└── interview_script.md       # Complete verbatim script for interviewers
```

**Performance Materials:**
```
artifacts/private/performance/{employee_id}/{review_cycle}/
├── performance_summary.md    # Executive summary of performance metrics
├── development_plan.md       # Personalized growth recommendations
└── okr_assessment.md         # OKR progress and goal alignment
```

## Technical Implementation Guidelines

### **File Organization Principles**
- **Public Artifacts** (`artifacts/public/`): Shareable materials, interview kits, process outputs
- **Private Artifacts** (`artifacts/private/`): Sensitive evaluations, personal feedback, confidential assessments
- **Context Directory** (`context/`): Company information, processes, team data, reference materials
- **Structured Subdirectories**: Logical grouping by date, person, process type, and category

### **Naming Conventions**
```
# File naming pattern
{process_type}_{subject_id}_{date}_{version}.{extension}

# Examples
interview_kit_candidate_001_2025-08-09_v1.md
performance_review_emp_123_2025-08-09_final.md
context_update_hiring_process_2025-08-09.yaml
```

### **Metadata Headers**
All generated files must include metadata:
```yaml
---
id: unique_identifier
type: document_type  
domain: hr_domain
created_date: YYYY-MM-DD
last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD
author: Junie
quality_score: X.X/10
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
visibility: public|private
version: X.X
