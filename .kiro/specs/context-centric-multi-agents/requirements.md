# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a Graph RAG-based context-centric multi-agent system that replicates and improves upon the Gefjon Growth project. The system will transform from the current manual orchestration approach (processing ~40 candidates/month with 32-day time-to-hire) to a fully automated, intelligent context-driven architecture that empowers multiple AI agents with semantically rich, relationship-aware context delivery.

The primary goal is to create an independent Graph RAG-based context service that serves as the foundation for any AI agent (current and future) to operate with intelligent, contextually relevant information discovered through semantic relationships, while automating 90% of the hiring process and reducing manual decision-making time from 4-6 hours per candidate to <4 hours for complete interview kit generation.

**Business Context**: This system directly supports Dunamis Capital's 2025 H2 OKRs for "Process SOP Institutionalization" and "Responsible Velocity & Dev Excellence," targeting 95% sprint goal achievement and ≥4.0/5 employee engagement scores while maintaining the existing $3,000 budget constraint and leveraging current AWS production infrastructure (Account: 319470692494).

**Current AI Tool Ecosystem**: The system builds upon our established multi-agent automation framework currently achieving 28% agent-authored code contribution rate through:
- **Gemini CLI** (Primary): Latest Gemini model via subscription, ReAct methodology, process workflow automation, cost-effective automated server execution
- **Claude Code CLI** (Technical): Claude Sonnet 4 (May 2025) via subscription, superior code generation, technical accuracy, interview kit creation with 200k context window
- **Amazon Q Developer CLI** (Testing): Automated test generation targeting 30% of new backend code (2025 H2 OKR), subscription-based AWS integration
- **OpenAI o3-mini/o4-mini** (Cost-Efficient Reasoning): 95% cost reduction from GPT-4 while maintaining strong reasoning capabilities for complex analysis
- **KIRO** (Strategic): Local deployment with MCP context access, decision-making, strategic planning
- **MCP Servers + A2A Protocol**: Agent orchestration and communication infrastructure

**Cost Optimization Strategy**: Using CLI agents with subscription models instead of API keys to significantly reduce operational costs while maintaining high-quality output through automated server-based execution.
