# Implementation Plan

This implementation plan converts the Graph RAG-based context-centric multi-agent system design into a series of actionable coding tasks. The plan provides **two complete implementation approaches**:

1. **Python-Based Custom Implementation**: Hand-crafted solution with maximum control and customization
2. **AWS Bedrock Native Implementation**: Cloud-native solution using AWS managed services for enterprise deployment and AWS partnership opportunities

Each task builds incrementally on previous work, following test-driven development practices and ensuring early validation of core functionality. Both approaches prioritize ultra-low-cost optimization, Graph RAG intelligent context discovery, and scalable architecture.

## Task Overview

The implementation is organized into discrete, manageable coding steps for both approaches:

### **Python Implementation Track**: Custom development with maximum flexibility
### **AWS Bedrock Implementation Track**: Cloud-native development with managed services

Each task includes specific requirements references, technical implementation details, and clear acceptance criteria. Teams can choose one approach or implement both for comparison and migration flexibility.

## Implementation Approach Selection

### **Python Implementation Benefits**:
- **Maximum Control**: Full customization of algorithms and logic
- **Cost Optimization**: Lower monthly costs with subscription model
- **Development Flexibility**: Rapid iteration and feature development
- **Technical Learning**: Deep understanding of Graph RAG implementation

### **AWS Bedrock Implementation Benefits**:
- **Enterprise Ready**: Managed services with built-in security and compliance
- **Faster Time-to-Market**: Leverage pre-built AWS AI/ML services
- **Automatic Scaling**: Handle variable loads without infrastructure management
- **AWS Partnership**: Strengthen relationship and access to AWS resources

### **Hybrid Approach**:
Teams can implement both approaches for:
- **Cost Comparison**: Validate actual costs and performance differences
- **Risk Mitigation**: Have backup implementation approach
- **Migration Flexibility**: Gradual migration between approaches
- **AWS Partnership**: Demonstrate commitment while maintaining control

### **Cost-Conscious Development Strategy**:

**Development Phase LLM Usage (TDD)**:
1. **Primary Development**: Gemini CLI (near-infinite quota for development)
2. **Fallback Development**: Local LLM (docker:ai/llama3.2) when Gemini quota exhausted
3. **Final Testing**: Claude Code CLI, Amazon Q Developer for production-quality validation
4. **Production**: Full LLM stack with subscription models

**Development Cost Optimization**:
```bash
# Development environment setup
docker pull ai/llama3.2
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 ai/llama3.2

# Primary development with Gemini CLI
gemini-cli --model gemini-2.0-flash --cost-tracking --dev-mode

# Fallback to local LLM when quota exhausted
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "llama3.2", "messages": [...]}'
```

**Development Quality Expectations**:
- **Local LLM (Llama 3.2)**: Basic functionality, structure validation, unit test generation
- **Gemini CLI**: Primary development, integration testing, architecture validation
- **Claude Code/Amazon Q**: Final quality validation, production-ready code generation
- **Production LLMs**: Full feature implementation with optimal performance

**TDD Development Workflow**:
1. **Structure & Architecture**: Gemini CLI for rapid iteration
2. **Component Development**: Local LLM for basic implementation
3. **Integration Testing**: Gemini CLI for complex logic validation
4. **Production Validation**: Claude Code CLI for final quality assurance
5. **Deployment**: Full LLM stack for production operations

### **Recommendation for AWS Meeting**:
Present the **AWS Bedrock implementation** as the primary approach for:
- **Partnership Alignment**: Shows commitment to AWS ecosystem
- **Enterprise Credibility**: Demonstrates understanding of enterprise requirements
- **Technical Sophistication**: Leverages cutting-edge AWS AI services
- **Business Value**: Clear ROI and operational benefits
