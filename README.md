cd gefjon-growth
pip install -e .
```

*Note: Requires Python ≥3.12, UV package manager, and MCP server configuration*

### **2. Complete Hiring Pipeline Automation**

Execute the full 7-stage hiring workflow with a single command:

```bash
# Complete workflow execution
python scripts/complete_workflow_final.py

# Alternative: Stage-by-stage execution
gemini run \
  --prompt "ai_docs/workflows/hiring/orchestrator.md" \
  --context "data/public/hiring/resume/20250731/candidates_20250731.json"
```

## Workflows & Guard-rails

1. **ReAct Methodology**: Follows Reason → Act → Observe → Repeat loops as defined in `.gemini/GEMINI.md` for consistent AI-powered analysis
2. **Structured Context Engineering**: Leverages organized `context/` directory with company values, hiring processes, and team information for accurate candidate alignment
3. **Live Documentation Principle**: README.md and project documentation automatically evolve to reflect current capabilities and focus areas
4. **Organized Artifact Management**: Clean separation between public (shareable) and private (sensitive) interview materials with logical subdirectory structure

## MCP Integration

| Capability                           | MCP Server            | Typical Trigger Words                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| AI-powered Research                  | `exa`                 | "research", "find info on", "deep dive on", "crawl site" |
| Sequential reasoning and planning    | `sequential-thinking` | "think step-by-step", "plan steps", "break down", "reason" |
| Browser automation & web interactions| `playwright`          | "open page", "click", "fill", "screenshot", "scrape"       |
| URL fetching & scraping              | `fetch`               | "fetch", "download", "HTTP GET", "scrape"                  |

Notes:
- Ensure MCP servers are properly configured before use.
- `exa` requires a valid API key passed in the remote URL (exaApiKey).
