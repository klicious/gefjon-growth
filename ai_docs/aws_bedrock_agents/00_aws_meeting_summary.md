# AWS Bedrock Agent Project - Meeting Documentation Summary

## Project Overview

**Objective:** Build a comprehensive AI agent system using Amazon Bedrock to automate 90% of Dunamis Capital's hiring processes, reducing manual decision-making time from 4-6 hours per candidate to ~17 minutes of confirmation-only tasks.

**Current State:** Manual orchestration using Gefjon Growth project with proven workflows for screening, assessment creation/evaluation, interview kit generation, and final evaluation.

**Target State:** Fully automated multi-agent system integrating with existing tools (Dooray Task, Outlook) and HR communications (hr@dunamiscap.com).
