# Conceptual Agent Architecture for Hiring Process Automation

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive multi-agent system architecture using Amazon Bedrock to automate Dunamis Capital's hiring processes. The system will reduce manual decision-making by 90% while maintaining high-quality candidate evaluation standards through specialized AI agents working in orchestrated workflows.

**Key Goals:**
- Automate candidate screening, assessment creation/evaluation, interview preparation, and final hiring decisions
- Minimize human intervention to confirmation-only decision points
- Integrate seamlessly with existing tools (Dooray Task, Outlook, HR email)
- Maintain consistency with current Gefjon Growth evaluation standards

## Agent Architecture Overview

### Multi-Agent Design Philosophy

Following Amazon Bedrock best practices, we employ a **microservices-style architecture** with specialized agents handling distinct domains:
