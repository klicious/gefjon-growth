# Revised AWS Bedrock Architecture - Context-Centric v2.0
**Executive Summary of Context-First Agent Infrastructure**

## Architecture Evolution

### From Agent-Centric to Context-Centric

**Previous Approach (v1.0):**
- 7 specialized agents (Orchestrator, Intake, Screening, etc.)
- Agent-specific knowledge bases
- Fixed workflow with human decision points
- Focus on automating specific HR tasks

**New Approach (v2.0):**
- **Context infrastructure as primary component**
- Universal agent interface supporting any AI system
- Token-optimized context delivery
- AI-validated context updates
- Agent-agnostic empowerment platform

## Core Architecture Principles

## Conclusion

This revised architecture transforms Gefjon Growth from an agent-focused system to a **context-empowered platform**. By prioritizing context quality, token optimization, and multi-channel updates, we create an infrastructure that:

✅ **Maximizes AI agent effectiveness** through research-driven context optimization
✅ **Ensures context quality** through multi-agent validation pipelines  
✅ **Supports any future AI system** through universal interfaces
✅ **Maintains real-time accuracy** through multi-channel update mechanisms
✅ **Scales efficiently** with intelligent resource management

The system creates the "absolute environment" you're seeking - one that empowers any AI agent to perform optimally with high-quality, appropriately-sized, and always-current context.
