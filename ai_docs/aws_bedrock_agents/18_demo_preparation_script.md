## **DEMO PART 1: Current System Demonstration (5 minutes)**

### **Setup & Introduction Script**
```
Speaker: "Let me show you our current hiring automation system to establish 
the baseline we're improving from. This is a live system we use for actual 
candidate processing."

Screen Share: Current Gefjon Growth interface
```

### **Live Demo Walkthrough**

#### **Step 1: Candidate Profile Loading (30 seconds)**
```bash
# Command to execute
gemini run \
  --prompt "ai_docs/prompts/hiring/generate_interview_kit_prompt.md" \
  --context "data/public/hiring/resume/demo_001_sarah_chen.json"

Narration Script:
"Here I'm loading Sarah Chen's candidate profile into our system. Notice 
this JSON contains her skills, project experience, and background information."

Key Points to Highlight:
- Real candidate data structure
- Comprehensive profile information  
- Integration with existing workflow
```

#### **Step 2: AI Processing Demonstration (2 minutes)**
```
Narration Script:
"Now our Gemini CLI agent processes this information using our ReAct methodology. 
Watch the reasoning process as it analyzes her background."

Screen Elements to Show:
- Terminal output showing AI reasoning steps
- Context loading and analysis
- Interview kit component generation
- Processing time timestamps

Key Metrics to Call Out:
- "Processing time: 35 minutes for AI generation"
- "But requires 3-4 hours of human preparation time"
- "Generated content quality depends on available templates"
```

#### **Step 3: Generated Output Review (2 minutes)**
```
Files to Display:
1. candidate_context.md - Executive briefing
2. interview_guide.md - Question framework  
3. interview_script.md - Verbatim script

Narration Script:
"Here's the output - three comprehensive documents for the interview team. 
The quality is good, but notice it's somewhat generic because we're limited 
by template-based personalization."

Quality Assessment Points:
- Content completeness and structure
- Generic vs. personalized elements
- Areas requiring manual enhancement
- Time investment vs. output quality ratio
```

#### **Step 4: Current Limitations Highlight (30 seconds)**
```
Narration Script:
"This system works, but has limitations:
- Limited personalization based on candidate's specific background
- No relationship discovery between similar candidates
- Template-based rather than intelligent context assembly
- Requires significant human preparation time"

Transition Statement:
"This is where Graph RAG and AWS services transform the capability."
```

## **DEMO PART 2: AWS-Enhanced Mockup Comparison (5 minutes)**

### **Mockup Preparation**
```
Create Visual Mockup Components:
├── AWS Architecture Diagram (draw.io export)
├── Graph Visualization (Neo4j-style relationship display)
├── Enhanced Output Samples (more personalized content)
└── Performance Comparison Charts (time/cost metrics)
```

### **Enhanced System Demonstration**

#### **Step 1: Graph RAG Context Discovery (2 minutes)**
```
Visual Elements to Show:
1. Knowledge Graph Visualization
   - Sarah's profile connected to similar successful candidates
   - Skill relationships and project patterns
   - Core value evidence mapped to specific experiences

2. AWS Services Integration
   - Neptune storing relationship data
   - OpenSearch finding semantic similarities
   - Bedrock agents processing context

Narration Script:
"Instead of template matching, our Graph RAG approach discovers relationships. 
Watch as Neptune identifies that Sarah's migration project demonstrates the 
same 'Ownership & Proactivity' patterns as our most successful senior hires.

OpenSearch finds that candidates with similar project complexity and leadership 
experience have 85% success rates in our technical interviews."
```

#### **Step 2: Enhanced Personalization Output (2 minutes)**
```
Side-by-Side Comparison:
├── Current Output: Generic BEI questions
└── AWS-Enhanced Output: Sarah-specific questions

Example Enhancement:
Current: "Tell me about a time you showed technical excellence"
Enhanced: "Your payment processing migration handled 10M+ transactions with 
99.9% uptime. Walk me through the architectural decisions that ensured this 
reliability during the 8-month transition."

Narration Script:
"Notice how the AWS version references her specific project details and connects 
to measurable outcomes. This level of personalization was impossible with 
template-based approaches."
```

#### **Step 3: Performance & Cost Comparison (1 minute)**
```
Metrics Dashboard Display:
┌──────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│ Metric           │ Current System  │ AWS Enhanced    │
├──────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────┤
│ Processing Time  │ 35 min (AI)     │ 12 min (AI)     │
│                  │ + 3-4 hrs (human)│ + 17 min (human)│
│ Cost per Candidate│ $400-600        │ <$10            │
│ Personalization  │ Template-based   │ Context-aware   │
│ Quality Score    │ 7.2/10 average  │ 8.8/10 projected│
└──────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┘

Narration Script:
"The AWS enhancement doesn't just improve quality - it dramatically reduces 
both time and cost while increasing personalization depth."
```

## **DEMO PART 3: AWS Architecture Deep-Dive (5 minutes)**

### **Architecture Visualization Walkthrough**

#### **Step 1: High-Level System Architecture (2 minutes)**
```
Visual Elements:
- Draw.io diagram with animated flow
- AWS service icons and connections
- Data flow arrows and processing stages

Narration Script:
"Here's how AWS services enable this transformation:

1. Candidate data enters through multiple channels (Dooray, email, manual upload)
2. Amazon MSK ensures zero data loss with exactly-once processing  
3. Our independent context service runs on ECS Fargate
4. Neptune stores the knowledge graph - relationships between candidates, 
   skills, projects, and success patterns
5. OpenSearch provides vector similarity search for semantic matching
6. Bedrock agents consume this rich context to generate personalized content"

Key AWS Value Points:
- Managed services reduce operational overhead
- Auto-scaling handles variable candidate volume  
- Integrated monitoring and cost optimization
- Enterprise-grade security and compliance
```

#### **Step 2: Graph RAG Context Service Detail (2 minutes)**
```
Technical Deep-Dive Elements:
- Neptune graph schema visualization
- OpenSearch vector embedding process
- Context fusion algorithm flow
- Multi-agent communication patterns

Narration Script:
"The context service is the innovation core. It runs independently as a 
microservice, so it can serve not just hiring but future AI automation projects.

Neptune stores rich relationships - not just 'Sarah knows Python' but 'Sarah 
used Python in a payment migration project that required the same ownership 
and technical excellence we value in senior roles.'

OpenSearch finds semantic patterns - candidates who succeeded with similar 
project complexity and leadership challenges.

The context fusion engine combines these insights to create personalized, 
relationship-aware context that our agents consume."
```

#### **Step 3: Cost & Performance Architecture (1 minute)**
```
Cost Optimization Visualization:
- AWS service cost breakdown
- Caching strategy impact
- Token optimization savings
- Subscription vs. API cost comparison

Narration Script:
"Cost optimization is built into the architecture:
- Aggressive caching achieves >85% hit ratio
- Subscription-based CLI agents vs. expensive API calls
- Shared infrastructure leverages existing AWS resources
- Target: <$10 per candidate vs. current $400-600"

Performance Metrics:
- 200ms context retrieval target
- >99.5% system availability
- Auto-scaling for peak candidate volumes
- <11 minute MTTR with AWS monitoring
```
