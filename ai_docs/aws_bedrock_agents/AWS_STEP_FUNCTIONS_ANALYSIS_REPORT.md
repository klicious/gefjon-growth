- Neptune + OpenSearch: $50-200/month base cost
- DynamoDB: $10-50/month
- Total: $15-25 per candidate + $100-300/month fixed costs
```

**Cost Impact**: 5-10x increase in per-candidate costs, plus significant fixed monthly costs.

#### **2. Complexity Overhead**
Your current system is elegantly simple:
```markdown
# Current: Single script execution
python scripts/complete_workflow_final.py

# Step Functions: Complex infrastructure
- 15+ AWS services to manage
- JSONata expressions to debug
- State machine definitions to maintain
- Multiple deployment environments
- IAM policies and security configurations
```

#### **3. Development Velocity Impact**
```

## Technical Deep Dive: Why Current System Excels

### **1. Context Engineering Excellence**
Your current system's context-centric architecture is superior:
```python
# Current: Rich context loading
def load_complete_context():
    context = {}
    context['company'] = load_yaml('context/company_info/mission_vision_values.yaml')
    context['hiring'] = load_yaml('context/hr_processes/hiring/hiring_stages.yaml')
    context['team'] = load_md('data/private/platform_development_team.md')
    return context

# Step Functions: Limited context passing
# JSONata expressions limited to 256KB
# Context must be serialized/deserialized between states
```

### **2. Error Handling & Recovery**
```python
# Current: Comprehensive error handling
try:
    result = process_candidate(candidate)
    if result.quality_score < 7.0:
        result = retry_with_enhanced_context(candidate)
    log_success(result)
except Exception as e:
    log_error(e, candidate)
    result = fallback_processing(candidate)

# Step Functions: Limited error context
# Retry logic is basic (exponential backoff only)
# Error details lost across state transitions
```

### **3. Data Flow Efficiency**
```python
# Current: Direct data access
candidate_data = load_json(f"data/candidates/{candidate_id}.json")
context = load_complete_context()
result = ai_agent.process(candidate_data, context)
save_result(result, f"artifacts/{candidate_id}/")

# Step Functions: Multiple serialization steps
# Data passed through DynamoDB/S3 between states
# JSONata transformations add latency
# Context reconstruction at each step
```

```python
# Add workflow state management
class WorkflowOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = WorkflowState()
        self.error_handler = ErrorHandler()
        self.quality_monitor = QualityMonitor()
    
    def execute_stage(self, stage, candidate):
        try:
            result = stage.execute(candidate)
            self.quality_monitor.validate(result)
            self.state.update(candidate.id, stage.name, result)
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            return self.error_handler.handle(e, candidate, stage)
```

### **2. Parallel Processing**
```python
# Add concurrent candidate processing
import asyncio
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

async def process_candidates_parallel(candidates):
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as executor:
        tasks = [
            executor.submit(process_single_candidate, candidate)
            for candidate in candidates
        ]
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    return results
```

### **3. Enhanced Monitoring**
```python
# Add comprehensive monitoring
class WorkflowMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics = MetricsCollector()
        self.alerts = AlertManager()
    
    def track_execution(self, candidate_id, stage, duration, quality_score):
        self.metrics.record({
            'candidate_id': candidate_id,
            'stage': stage,
            'duration': duration,
            'quality_score': quality_score,
            'timestamp': datetime.utcnow()
        })
        
        if quality_score < 7.0:
            self.alerts.send_quality_alert(candidate_id, stage, quality_score)
```

### **4. Graph RAG Implementation (Python-Based)**
```python
# Implement Graph RAG without AWS Neptune
import networkx as nx
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

class PythonGraphRAG:
    def __init__(self):
        self.knowledge_graph = nx.Graph()
        self.embedder = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
        self.vector_store = {}
    
    def add_candidate_context(self, candidate_id, skills, experience):
        # Add nodes and relationships to knowledge graph
        self.knowledge_graph.add_node(candidate_id, type='candidate')
        for skill in skills:
            self.knowledge_graph.add_node(skill, type='skill')
            self.knowledge_graph.add_edge(candidate_id, skill, relation='has_skill')
        
        # Generate and store embeddings
        profile_text = f"{' '.join(skills)} {experience}"
        embedding = self.embedder.encode(profile_text)
        self.vector_store[candidate_id] = embedding
    
    def retrieve_context(self, candidate_id, query_intent):
        # Graph-based context retrieval
        graph_context = self._get_graph_neighbors(candidate_id)
        
        # Vector-based similarity search
        vector_context = self._find_similar_candidates(candidate_id)
        
        return {
            'graph_relationships': graph_context,
            'similar_candidates': vector_context
        }
```
