# Sharable AWS Bedrock Implementation Plan

This directory contains a redacted version of our internal AWS Bedrock implementation plan. The documents have been prepared for consultation with AWS, focusing on the business logic and high-level architecture while omitting proprietary details related to our context engineering, specific prompts, and internal workflow orchestration.

The purpose of these documents is to provide enough information for AWS to guide us on best practices for implementing a multi-agent system on the AWS stack, particularly with Bedrock, Neptune, and OpenSearch.

The following documents are included:

*   `sharable_conceptual_architecture.md`: A high-level overview of the multi-agent architecture.
*   `sharable_hiring_workflow.md`: A description of the end-to-end hiring workflow to be automated.
*   `sharable_technical_overview.md`: A summary of the technical implementation, focusing on the AWS services we plan to use.
*   `sharable_integrations.md`: Details on the planned integrations with external systems.
*   `sharable_executive_summary.md`: A one-page executive summary of the project.
