# Executive Summary: AI-Powered Multi-Agent Hiring System
**One-Page Overview for AWS Partnership Meeting**

---

## üéØ **Business Opportunity**
Transform our hiring process from **4-6 hours per candidate to under 20 minutes** using AWS services integration with an advanced context-aware multi-agent automation system.

**Current Pain**: High operational cost per candidate and long hiring cycles.
**AWS Solution**: A highly efficient, automated system with a significant ROI.
**Annual Savings**: Projected to be over **$300,000** with a 3-month ROI break-even.

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Advanced Context-Aware Architecture**
**Our Approach**: Combine a knowledge graph (Amazon Neptune) with vector similarity search (Amazon OpenSearch) for intelligent, relationship-aware hiring context.

**Key Differentiator**: Our system moves beyond simple keyword matching to understand the relationships between skills, experience, and success, creating a reusable context service for future AI automation.
