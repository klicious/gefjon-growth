# Agentic Hiring Workflow: Step Functions + JSONata + Bedrock
*Updated for Devcraft Session Requirements*

## Executive Summary

This document details the end-to-end **Agentic Workflow** for hiring automation using **AWS Step Functions with JSONata** and **Amazon Bedrock Agents**. Following Devcraft session guidance, our workflow is implemented as a state machine that reduces manual intervention from 4-6 hours per candidate to ~17 minutes of decision confirmation time.

The system leverages **Step Functions** for orchestration, **JSONata** for intelligent data transformations, and **Bedrock Agents** for AI-powered decision making, creating a robust and auditable hiring pipeline.

## Detailed Stage-by-Stage Implementation

## Stage 1: Input Validation & Resume Intake
**Step Functions States:** ValidateInput → IntakeAgent → TransformForScreening  
**Duration:** Real-time processing (2-3 minutes)  
**Human Involvement:** None

### **State 1: ValidateInput (Pass State with JSONata)**
```json
{
  "ValidateInput": {
    "Type": "Pass",
    "Comment": "JSONata validation and normalization of candidate input",
    "Parameters": {
      "validatedCandidate.$": "$exists($.candidateData.resume) and $exists($.candidateData.email) ? $.candidateData : $error('Missing required fields: resume or email')",
      "processId.$": "$uuid()",
      "timestamp.$": "$now()",
      "source.$": "$.candidateData.source ? $.candidateData.source : 'unknown'",
      "normalizedEmail.$": "$lowercase($trim($.candidateData.email))"
    },
    "ResultPath": "$.validated",
    "Next": "IntakeAgent"
  }
}
```

**JSONata Transformations:**
- **Input Validation:** Ensures required fields (resume, email) are present
- **Data Normalization:** Standardizes email format, generates unique process ID
- **Source Tracking:** Identifies candidate source (task management, email, etc.)
- **Timestamp Generation:** Records exact processing start time

### **State 2: IntakeAgent (Bedrock Task State)**
```json
{
  "IntakeAgent": {
    "Type": "Task",
    "Comment": "Bedrock Agent for resume processing and data extraction",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1:account:agent/intake-agent-id",
    "Parameters": {
      "sessionId.$": "$.validated.processId",
      "inputText.$": "$string($.validated.validatedCandidate)",
      "enableTrace": true,
      "sessionAttributes": {
        "stage": "intake",
        "candidateSource.$": "$.validated.source"
      }
    },
    "ResultPath": "$.intakeResult",
    "Retry": [
      {
        "ErrorEquals": ["Bedrock.ThrottlingException"],
        "IntervalSeconds": 2,
        "MaxAttempts": 3,
        "BackoffRate": 2.0
      },
      {
        "ErrorEquals": ["Bedrock.ValidationException"],
        "IntervalSeconds": 1,
        "MaxAttempts": 2
      }
    ],
    "Catch": [
      {
        "ErrorEquals": ["States.ALL"],
        "Next": "HandleIntakeError",
        "ResultPath": "$.error"
      }
    ],
    "Next": "TransformForScreening"
  }
}
```

**Bedrock Agent Configuration:**
```yaml
IntakeAgent:
  foundationModel: "anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0"  # Fast, cost-effective
  instruction: |
    You are an Intake Agent responsible for processing candidate resumes and extracting structured information.
    
    Your tasks:
    1. Parse resume content (PDF, DOC, or text format)
    2. Extract key information: contact details, experience, education, skills
    3. Normalize data into standard JSON format
    4. Validate completeness and flag missing information
    5. Generate candidate profile summary
    
    Output format: JSON with candidateProfile, contactInfo, experienceLevel, and completenessScore
  
  tools:
    - name: "pdf_parser"
      description: "Extract text and structure from PDF resumes"
    - name: "data_validator" 
      description: "Validate extracted candidate data against schema"
    - name: "duplicate_checker"
      description: "Check for existing candidates in database"
```

**Automated Actions:**
1. **Document Processing**
   - Parse PDF/DOC resume files using integrated tools
   - Extract text content and maintain formatting structure
   - Handle multiple file formats and encoding issues

2. **Data Extraction**
   - Contact information (name, email, phone, location)
   - Professional experience with dates and descriptions
   - Education background and certifications
   - Technical and soft skills identification

3. **Data Normalization**
   - Standardize date formats and experience calculations
   - Normalize skill names and categorization
   - Generate experience level assessment (Entry/Mid/Senior)
   - Create unique candidate identifier

4. **Quality Validation**
   - Completeness scoring (0-100% based on available information)
   - Data consistency checks (dates, contact info validation)
   - Duplicate candidate detection using email and name matching

### **State 3: TransformForScreening (Pass State with JSONata)**
```json
{
  "TransformForScreening": {
    "Type": "Pass",
    "Comment": "JSONata transformation to prepare screening context",
    "Parameters": {
      "screeningInput.$": "$merge([$.intakeResult.candidateProfile, {\"companyContext\": $.companyContext, \"jobRequirements\": $.jobDescription.requirements, \"screeningCriteria\": $.companyContext.coreValues, \"candidateMetadata\": {\"processId\": $.validated.processId, \"source\": $.validated.source, \"intakeTimestamp\": $.validated.timestamp, \"completenessScore\": $.intakeResult.completenessScore}}])",
      "candidateId.$": "$.intakeResult.candidateId",
      "stage": "screening",
      "nextStagePrep": {

      }
    },
    "ResultPath": "$.screeningPrep",
    "Next": "ScreeningAgent"
  }
}
```

**JSONata Context Preparation:**
- **Company Context Integration:** Merges candidate data with company values and job requirements
- **Metadata Enrichment:** Adds process tracking and quality metrics
- **Conditional Logic Setup:** Prepares flags for downstream decision making
- **Skill Prioritization:** Identifies top 5 skills for focused evaluation

### **Output Generated:**
```json

      "experienceLevel": "Senior",
      "primarySkills": ["Python", "AWS", "Docker", "PostgreSQL", "REST APIs"]
    }
  }
}
```

### **Automatic State Transitions:**
- **Success:** Automatically proceeds to ScreeningAgent state
- **Validation Error:** Routes to HandleIntakeError for manual intervention
- **Bedrock Throttling:** Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Data Quality Issues:** Flags for human review in next stage

---

## Stage 2: Intelligent Candidate Screening
**Step Functions States:** ScreeningAgent → EvaluateScreeningResult → [HumanReview | TransformForAssessment | RejectCandidate]  
**Duration:** 15-20 minutes processing + 5 minutes human review (if needed)  
**Human Involvement:** 5 minutes (decision confirmation for borderline cases)

### **State 1: ScreeningAgent (Bedrock Task State)**
```json

**JSONata Routing Logic:**
- **Automatic Pass:** High confidence (>0.8) + high score (>7.5) + PASS recommendation
- **Human Review Required:** Low confidence (<0.8) or NEEDS_REVIEW recommendation
- **Automatic Rejection:** High confidence (>0.8) + FAIL recommendation
- **Default Safety:** Any edge cases route to human review
