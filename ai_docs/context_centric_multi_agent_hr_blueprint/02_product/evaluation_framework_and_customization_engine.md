# Evaluation Framework & Customization Engine â€” Enhanced with Top-Tier Industry Standards

## Purpose
Define a human-readable, machine-actionable configuration (YAML DSL) that allows each client and team to customize their hiring process, scoring rubrics, thresholds, and safeguards without code changes, while maintaining Top-Tier Industry Standards for production-ready engineering assessment.

## Design Principles
- **Excellence over adequacy**: Prefer robust, production-ready engineering over bare functionality
- **Explainability**: Every score must be supported by evidence with citations to source artifacts and chunks
- **Customizability**: Teams can change criteria, weights, scoring anchors, and pass logic via YAML
- **Production readiness**: Assess durability under real-world conditions and failures
- **Systems thinking**: Favor sound architecture, clean abstractions, and scalable design
- **Fairness & bias control**: PII redaction, structured comparisons, calibration sets, and bias checks
- **Deterministic aggregation**: Clear formulas, thresholds, tie-break rules, and overrides
- **Cost-aware**: Token and model routing policies per stage; reuse cached analyses

## Cross-References
- `00_overview/README.md` (vision and MVP)
- `03_architecture/architecture_overview.md` (PRD & architecture)
- `03_architecture/data_ingestion_normalization_pipeline.md` (normalized inputs and provenance)
- `04_security_compliance/security_compliance_and_data_governance.md` (bias/PII controls)
- `06_execution_roadmap/task_breakdown.md` (tasks to implement this DSL)

## Enhanced Scoring and Aggregation (Top-Tier Standards)

### Scoring Philosophy
- **Production-first assessment**: Prioritize production risks over surface polish
- **Evidence-based evaluation**: All comments must reference specific files/lines/examples
- **Calibrated expectations**: Adjust standards based on candidate level while maintaining quality bar
- **Systems thinking**: Evaluate architecture, boundaries, and extensibility

### Normalization and Thresholds
- **Scale**: 1-5 point scale with detailed behavioral anchors
- **Weighted scoring**: Functional Correctness (25%) + Code Quality (20%) + Testing (15%) + Documentation (10%) + Ownership (15%) + Scalability (15%) + Problem Solving (10%)
- **Decision thresholds**: 
  - Strong Hire: â‰¥4.5 (Ready for senior-level responsibilities)
  - Hire: â‰¥3.8 (Strong engineer with minor gaps)
  - Lean Hire: â‰¥3.0 (Competent with potential)
  - No Hire: <3.0 (Significant gaps)

## Enhanced Prompts and Tool Functions

### System Prompt Template (Top-Tier Standards)
```
You are an expert technical evaluator applying Top-Tier Industry Standards. Your goal is to identify well-qualified engineering talent capable of building and operating production systems with strong reliability, scalability, and maintainability.

EVALUATION PHILOSOPHY:
- Excellence over adequacy: Prefer robust, production-ready engineering over bare functionality
- Production readiness: Assess durability under real-world conditions and failures
- Systems thinking: Favor sound architecture, clean abstractions, and scalable design
- Operational excellence: Expect sensible observability, testing, and reliability practices

EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS:
- Always tie comments to concrete evidence (files/lines/examples)
- Provide specific file and line references for all scoring decisions
- Focus on production-breaking risks over surface polish
- Calibrate expectations to candidate level while maintaining quality bar

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Use the structured JSON schema provided
- Include production readiness indicators for each criterion
- Provide actionable, respectful feedback grounded in evidence
```

## Integration with Existing Framework

### Compatibility with Current System
- **Backward compatible**: Existing YAML configurations continue to work
- **Enhanced mode**: New `evaluation_philosophy: "top_tier_industry_standards"` flag enables enhanced evaluation
- **Gradual migration**: Teams can opt-in to Top-Tier Standards per role or process
- **Consistent output**: Same JSON schema with additional Top-Tier indicators

### Integration Points
- **Take-home evaluation**: Direct integration with `ai_docs/prompts/hiring/evaluate_take_home_assignment_prompt.md`
- **Evaluation sheets**: Enhanced templates in `artifacts/public/hiring/evaluation_sheets/`
- **Workflow integration**: Seamless integration with `ai_docs/workflows/hiring_end_to_end.md`
- **Context engineering**: Leverages existing context management and artifact storage

## Calibration Protocol (Top-Tier Standards)

### Quality Assurance
- **Weekly calibration**: Sample of 20 evaluations reviewed by senior engineering panel
- **Inter-rater reliability**: Track Cohen's kappa between human and model-assisted scores
- **Goldset maintenance**: Curated set of labeled candidates with consensus Top-Tier scores
- **Continuous improvement**: Adjust anchors and weights based on hiring outcomes

### Bias Controls (Enhanced)
- **Production focus bias**: Ensure evaluation doesn't penalize candidates for missing enterprise patterns not explicitly required
- **Experience level calibration**: Adjust expectations appropriately for junior vs senior candidates
- **Technology stack neutrality**: Focus on principles and patterns rather than specific technologies
- **Cultural bias mitigation**: Emphasize technical excellence over communication style preferences

## Security & Compliance (Enhanced)

### Audit Trail
- **Comprehensive logging**: Every evaluation decision with evidence references
- **PII protection**: Enhanced redaction with production-grade security
- **Model usage tracking**: Detailed cost and performance metrics
- **Quality metrics**: Track evaluation consistency and accuracy over time
