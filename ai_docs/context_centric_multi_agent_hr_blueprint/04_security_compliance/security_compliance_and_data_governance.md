# Security, Compliance, and Data Governance

Purpose: Establish security controls, compliance standards, and governance practices for handling candidate/employee data in a context-centric multi-agent HR system.

## Security Controls
- Access Control (RBAC): Roles — Admin, Recruiter, Interviewer, Auditor. Principle of least privilege.
- Authentication: SSO/SAML planned; OAuth2 for API; MFA optional in MVP.
- Encryption: TLS 1.2+ in transit; AES-256 at rest for sensitive stores.
- Secret Management: Vault/KMS for keys and credentials; no secrets in code or prompts.
- Network: Private subnets for services; WAF for public endpoints; IP allowlist for admin.
- Device/Endpoint: Admin console restricted; logs redacted of PII.

## Compliance Frameworks
- GDPR: Lawful basis, consent, data subject rights (access, rectification, erasure, portability), DPA with subprocessors.
- EEO/Anti-Discrimination: Prohibit protected-class inferences; EEO-safe interview content.
- Local Regulations: Country-specific privacy/employment laws (to be enumerated during client onboarding).
- Data Retention: Define retention by artifact type (e.g., 12 months for unsuccessful candidates unless consent extended).

## Data Governance
- Data Classification: Public, Internal, Confidential-PII, Confidential-Sensitive.
- Data Lineage: Track provenance for all artifacts (raw → normalized → outputs); checksums.
- Audit Logging: Immutable logs for all decisions, prompts, responses, and approvals; time-stamped.
- Anonymization/Pseudonymization: Apply for blind review and analytics datasets.

## DPIA (Data Protection Impact Assessment) Checklist
- Purpose and necessity documented
- Categories of data (PII, sensitive, special categories)
- Risk assessment and mitigations (see Risk Register)
- Data transfers outside region and safeguards
- Retention schedule and deletion process

## Vendor & Model Management
- Provider Due Diligence: Security posture, data handling, regional data residency options.
- Data Usage: No training on customer data; opt-out enforced; redaction before send where possible.
- Model Routing: Prefer providers with enterprise privacy commitments; regional endpoints.

## Incident Response
- Detection: Alerts on anomalous access, PII leakage, policy violations.
- Containment: Revoke tokens, rotate keys, disable routes; switch to offline artifacts.
- Notification: Customer and regulator notification flows (as applicable).
- Post-Incident Review: Root cause analysis; control improvements.

## Compliance Checkpoints (Pre-Deployment)
- DPA executed with subprocessors
- EEO content and question bank reviewed by legal/HR
- Data retention configured and tested deletion
- Access review completed; least privilege enforced

## Bias Mitigation Protocols
- Diverse evaluation criteria; standardized rubrics and scoring scales
- Blind review elements where feasible
- Regular bias audits; document findings and remediations

## Client Onboarding Artifacts
- Security & Compliance Overview (this document)
- Data Flow & Storage Diagram
- DPA template and Subprocessor list
- Retention & Deletion Policy

## Open Items (Client-Specific)
- Regional data residency requirements
- Custom retention policies
- Approved model providers and data handling constraints
