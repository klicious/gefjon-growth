# ROI Model Framework — Enhanced with Top-Tier Industry Standards Value

## Purpose
Provide a clear, defensible way to quantify benefits and costs for buyers, with enhanced value proposition based on Top-Tier Industry Standards evaluation quality and production-ready hiring outcomes.

## How to Use
- Fill Inputs for the client; apply Formulas to compute monthly and annual ROI
- Use Scenarios for sanity checks; export highlights to presentation materials
- Emphasize quality improvements and long-term value of Top-Tier hiring standards

## Cross-References
- `07_presentation/pitch_deck_outline.md` — use ROI highlights on slides
- `05_business_model/business_model_and_pricing.md` — ensure price bands align with modeled savings
- `06_execution_roadmap/mvp_plan_5day_demo.md` — MVP success criteria mapping
- `06_execution_roadmap/metrics_and_kpis.md` — performance validation metrics

## Enhanced Key Inputs (per client)

### Volume & Funnel Metrics
- **Monthly candidates screened** (V): Total candidate volume
- **% to interviews** (p_interview): Conversion rate to interview stage
- **Hires per month** (H): Successful placements
- **Quality hire rate** (p_quality): % of hires performing above expectations at 6 months
- **Top-tier candidate identification rate** (p_top_tier): % of strong candidates identified

### Time & Cost Parameters
- **Recruiter fully loaded hourly cost** (C_r): $50-80/hr typical
- **Hiring manager fully loaded hourly cost** (C_h): $100-150/hr typical
- **Senior engineer hourly cost** (C_eng): $120-200/hr for technical evaluation
- **Baseline manual screening time per candidate** (T_screen_base): 15-25 minutes
- **Top-Tier automated screening time** (T_screen_auto): 5-8 minutes
- **Baseline interviewer prep time** (T_prep_base): 45-60 minutes
- **Enhanced automated prep time** (T_prep_auto): 10-15 minutes
- **Technical evaluation time baseline** (T_tech_base): 120-180 minutes
- **Automated technical evaluation time** (T_tech_auto): 30-45 minutes

### Quality & Risk Metrics
- **Cost of vacancy per day per role** (C_vac_day): $300-800/day
- **Baseline time-to-fill** (TTF_base): 35-60 days
- **Expected time-to-fill reduction** (ΔTTF): 10-20 days with Top-Tier standards
- **Cost of bad hire** (C_bad_hire): $50,000-150,000 (replacement + productivity loss)
- **Bad hire rate reduction** (p_bad_hire_red): 40-60% improvement with rigorous evaluation
- **Productivity ramp time reduction** (ΔRamp): 2-4 weeks faster for quality hires

### Spend & Pricing
- **Agency spend per hire** (A_spend): $15,000-30,000 typical
- **Agency spend reduction %** (p_agency_red): 30-50% through better internal process
- **Platform monthly fee** (F_platform): Tiered pricing
- **Price per candidate evaluated** (P_cand): $3-8 for Top-Tier assessment
- **Candidates billed per month** (V_bill): Often = V
- **Implementation fee** (F_impl): $15,000-50,000 depending on complexity
- **Amortization period** (N_impl): 12-24 months

## Enhanced Derived Values

### Time Savings (Production-Ready Assessment)
- **Screening time savings per candidate**: S_screen = T_screen_base − T_screen_auto
- **Technical evaluation time savings**: S_tech = T_tech_base − T_tech_auto
- **Interview prep time savings**: S_prep = T_prep_base − T_prep_auto
- **Total time savings per candidate**: S_total = S_screen + S_tech + S_prep

### Value Calculations
- **Recruiter time value per candidate**: V_r = (S_screen / 60) × C_r
- **Technical evaluator time value**: V_tech = (S_tech / 60) × C_eng
- **HM time value per interviewed candidate**: V_hm_int = (S_prep / 60) × C_h
- **HM time value averaged per candidate**: V_hm = V_hm_int × p_interview

## Enhanced Monthly Benefit Components

### Direct Time Savings
- **Recruiter screening savings**: B_r = V × V_r
- **Technical evaluation savings**: B_tech = V × V_tech × p_technical_eval
- **Interviewer/HM prep savings**: B_hm = V × V_hm
- **Total time savings**: B_time = B_r + B_tech + B_hm

### Quality Improvements (Top-Tier Standards)
- **Cost-of-vacancy reduction**: B_vac = H × ΔTTF × C_vac_day
- **Bad hire cost avoidance**: B_bad_hire = H × C_bad_hire × p_bad_hire_red
- **Productivity ramp improvement**: B_ramp = H × (ΔRamp × 5 × C_h)  # 5 days/week
- **Agency spend reduction**: B_agency = H × A_spend × p_agency_red

### Long-Term Value (Quality Compounding)
- **Retention improvement value**: B_retention = H × 0.2 × C_bad_hire  # 20% retention improvement
- **Team productivity multiplier**: B_team_prod = H × 0.1 × (C_h × 40 × 12)  # 10% team productivity boost
- **Innovation capacity increase**: B_innovation = H × 0.05 × (C_h × 40 × 12)  # 5% innovation time

### Total Monthly Benefits
**B_total = B_time + B_vac + B_bad_hire + B_ramp + B_agency + B_retention + B_team_prod + B_innovation**

## Enhanced Monthly Platform Cost

### Platform Costs
- **Base platform fee**: K_platform_base = F_platform
- **Usage-based costs**: K_usage = P_cand × V_bill
- **Implementation amortization**: K_impl = F_impl / N_impl
- **Total monthly cost**: K_total = K_platform_base + K_usage + K_impl

### ROI Calculations
- **Net monthly value**: Net = B_total − K_total
- **ROI percentage**: ROI_% = (Net / K_total) × 100%
- **Payback period (months)**: Payback = F_impl / max(Net, 1)
- **Annual ROI**: Annual_ROI = (Net × 12) / (K_total × 12) × 100%
