# Sales Playbook (Pilot → Contract)

Purpose: Provide a repeatable motion from discovery to pilot to contract for the HR automation platform.

## ICPs & Buyer Personas
- SMB Tech (50–200): Founder/Head of People; speed > integrations; budget constrained
- Mid-market SaaS (200–1,000): VP People, TA Lead, Eng Manager; ROI and compliance
- Enterprise Tech (1,000+): Procurement, Security, Legal, VP People; strict compliance, SSO, data residency

## Qualification (SPICED/MEDDICC Hybrid)
- Situation: Volumes, roles in hiring plan, current tools
- Pain: Bottlenecks (screening, interview consistency, coordination)
- Impact: Time-to-hire, interviewer hours, offer acceptance, quality
- Champion: Who owns success? (TA Lead/Eng Manager)
- Economic Buyer: Budget holder and thresholds
- Decision: Process, timeline, legal/compliance steps
- Competition: Incumbent ATS or point tools; status quo risk

## Pilot Structure (4–6 Weeks)
- Scope: 1–2 roles; success criteria: quality ≥8.5/10; time saved; adoption
- Milestones: kickoff, mid-point review, final readout
