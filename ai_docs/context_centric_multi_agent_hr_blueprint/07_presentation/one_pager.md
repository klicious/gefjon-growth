# Gefjon Growth — Context-Centric HR Automation

## The Problem
Hiring is too slow, inconsistent, and biased. Teams juggle fragmented tools and manual workflows, leading to poor candidate experience and variable outcomes.

## Our Solution
A vendor-agnostic, context-centric, multi-agent platform that automates the hiring lifecycle end-to-end:
- Ingests diverse candidate materials (PDF/DOCX/MD/PPTX/XLSX, images, emails, GitHub/URLs)
- Generates consistent screening summaries with strengths/risks
- Matches take-home assignments and produces evaluation sheets
- Creates tailored interview kits (BEI + technical)
- Compiles stage-by-stage evaluations with clear rationale

## Why It’s Different
- Context-first customization by company values and role competencies
- Guardrails and observability for compliance and auditability
- Deterministic demo mode with reproducible outputs

## Outcomes (Targets)
- Time-to-hire reduction: 40–60%
- Interviewer time savings: 60–80%
- Generated material quality: ≥ 8.5/10

## What We’ll Show (Working Demo)
- Resume → Screening → Assignment → Interview → Evaluation for 1–2 roles
- Customization toggles and rationale tracking

## Security & Compliance
- GDPR-ready controls (consent, retention, DSAR)
- EEO-safe interview content; PII redaction policies
- RBAC and audit logs (demo-level, production-ready roadmap)

## Pricing (Indicative)
- Essential: $0.8k–$2k/mo | Pro: $2k–$6k/mo | Enterprise: $6k+/mo
- Usage-based add-ons: tokens, OCR, storage
- Design partner discounts available

## Pilot Proposal (4–6 Weeks)
- Scope: 1–2 roles; success metrics: quality ≥ 8.5/10, time saved, adoption
- Milestones: kickoff → midpoint → readout

## Next Steps
- Confirm target roles and values emphasis
- Share sample candidate materials
- Security review kick-off (DPA template available)
