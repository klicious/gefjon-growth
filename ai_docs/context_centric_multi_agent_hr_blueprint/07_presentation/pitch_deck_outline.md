# Pitch Deck Outline (Client Presentation)

Purpose: Provide a high-quality, persuasive, and structured slide outline optimized for a 20–25 minute client pitch with a working demo.

## 1. Executive Summary
- One-liner value proposition
- Key outcomes (time-to-hire ↓40–60%, interviewer hours ↓60–80%, quality ≥8.5/10)
- What we’ll show today (end-to-end working model)

## 2. The Problem
- Hiring is slow, inconsistent, and biased
- Fragmented tools; manual, error-prone workflows
- Evidence points (benchmarks, anecdotes relevant to client)

## 3. Our Approach
- Context-centric multi-agent system
- Customization by company values and role competencies
- Guardrails, observability, and auditability built-in

- Ingestion → Context Fabric → Agents (Screening, Assignment, Interview, Evaluation)
- Deterministic demo mode and fallbacks

## 5. Live Demo (Agenda)
- Inputs & Context → Screening → Assignment → Interview → Evaluation
- What to look for: customization toggles, rationale, auditability

## 6. Results & ROI

- Case-style example (synthetic if needed)

## 7. Security, Compliance, and Risk
