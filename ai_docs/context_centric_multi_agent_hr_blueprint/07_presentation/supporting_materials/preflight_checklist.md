# Demo Preflight Checklist (T-24h to T-0)

Purpose: Ensure the client demo runs flawlessly with deterministic outputs, compliance guardrails, and contingency plans.

## 1) Environment & Access
- [ ] Meeting link created; backup dial-in available
- [ ] Presenter, Driver, Analyst invited; roles confirmed
- [ ] Screen-share and recording permissions enabled
- [ ] Time-zone and duration confirmed with client

## 2) Data & Determinism
- [ ] Inputs snapshot finalized (candidate files, context configs)
- [ ] Deterministic mode ON (fixed seed; cache warmed)
- [ ] Context bundle IDs recorded; hashes verified
- [ ] Offline copies of all outputs prepared (PDF/MD)

## 3) Content Readiness
- [ ] Pitch deck final (exported to PDF as backup)
- [ ] Demo script rehearsed; time boxed per section
- [ ] One-pager updated with client logo (if permitted)
- [ ] Artifacts linked in deck (architecture, security, business model)

## 4) Compliance & Safety
- [ ] PII redaction policy validated; no sensitive info on-screen
- [ ] EEO-safe language verified in guides and scripts
- [ ] Audit logging enabled for demo run (or mocked)
- [ ] DPA/subprocessor talking points ready

## 5) Technical Checks
- [ ] Network stable; VPN off if bandwidth-limiting
- [ ] Browser tabs minimized; notifications off
- [ ] Demo accounts logged in; no token expirations
- [ ] Alternate model/provider route configured

## 6) Contingency Plans
- [ ] Offline artifact walkthrough plan rehearsed
- [ ] Fallback slides for each live step prepared
- [ ] Q&A backup materials (pricing sheet, security one-pager)

## 7) Rehearsal & Roles
- [ ] Dry run 1: full flow with timing
- [ ] Dry run 2: simulate failure and switch to offline mode
- [ ] Presenter/Driver/Analyst handoffs practiced

## 8) Day-of Runbook (T-60 to T+10)
- T-60: Final artifact/hash check; open tabs in order
- T-30: Join early; confirm A/V; screen-share test
- T-10: Confirm attendee list; align on success metrics
- T+00: Start on time; follow script
- T+05: Confirm agenda & outcomes; proceed to demo
- T+25: ROI, pricing corridors, pilot proposal
- T+35: Q&A
- T+45: Next steps and follow-up email template

## 9) Post-Demo
- [ ] Send follow-up within 2 hours: deck, one-pager, pilot proposal draft
- [ ] Log notes, objections, decisions; update CRM
- [ ] Schedule pilot scoping call
