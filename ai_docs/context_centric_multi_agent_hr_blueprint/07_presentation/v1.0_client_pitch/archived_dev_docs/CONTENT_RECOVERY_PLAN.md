# Content Recovery Plan: Restoring Critical Slide Content

## Recovery Strategy Overview

**Objective**: Restore critical technical depth and strategic content from archived slides while maintaining presentation-ready format.

**Approach**: Enhance existing reorganized slides and create missing slides to ensure 100% content coverage from the original 23 archived slides.

## Phase 1: Critical Content Enhancement

### 1.1 Enhance Solution Overview (05a)
**Target**: `slides/02_problem_solution/05a_solution_overview.md`
**Source**: `slides/archived/05_solution_overview.md`
**Action**: Integrate detailed 7-stage pipeline, context engineering methodology, and technology stack
**Priority**: CRITICAL

### 1.2 Expand Workflow Stages (05b)
**Target**: `slides/02_problem_solution/05b_workflow_stages.md`
**Source**: `slides/archived/08_workflow_stages.md`
**Action**: Add quality gates, thresholds, BEI methodology, and technical specifications
**Priority**: CRITICAL

### 1.3 Verify Results Content (07a)
**Target**: `slides/03_proof_results/07a_perfect_execution.md`
**Source**: `slides/archived/07_achievements_metrics.md`
**Action**: Confirm all metrics and context are preserved
**Priority**: HIGH

## Phase 2: Missing Slide Creation

### 2.1 Create Missing Core Slides
| Archived Source | New Location | Content Focus |
|----------------|--------------|---------------|
| `06.5_context_engineering.md` | `02_problem_solution/06b_context_engineering_deep_dive.md` | Advanced context methodology |
| `09.5_live_demo_materials.md` | `04_demo_differentiation/12b_demo_materials.md` | Specific demo content |
| `11_business_model.md` | `05_business_implementation/11c_complete_business_model.md` | Full business model |
| `14_future_roadmap.md` | `05_business_implementation/14c_future_expansion.md` | Long-term vision |

### 2.2 Verify All Archived Content Coverage
**Action**: Map every archived slide to reorganized equivalent
**Deliverable**: Complete coverage matrix
**Priority**: HIGH

## Phase 3: Content Integration Standards

### 3.1 Presentation Format Preservation
- Maintain SLIDE CONTENT + VISUAL ELEMENTS + SPEAKER SCRIPT + SLIDE INTENTION structure
- Keep slide content concise (under 50 words on screen)
- Move detailed content to speaker scripts and appendices

### 3.2 Technical Depth Integration
- Include technical specifications in speaker scripts
- Add detailed appendices for complex topics
- Maintain visual-first approach with supporting detail

### 3.3 Strategic Content Balance
- Preserve investor-grade technical depth
- Maintain customer-facing strategic messaging
- Ensure content supports both audiences

## Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1 Tasks
- [ ] Enhance 05a_solution_overview.md with 7-stage pipeline details
- [ ] Expand 05b_workflow_stages.md with quality gates and specifications
- [ ] Verify 07a_perfect_execution.md content completeness
- [ ] Update speaker scripts with technical depth

### Phase 2 Tasks
- [ ] Create 06b_context_engineering_deep_dive.md
- [ ] Create 12b_demo_materials.md
- [ ] Create 11c_complete_business_model.md
- [ ] Create 14c_future_expansion.md
- [ ] Map all 23 archived slides to reorganized equivalents

### Phase 3 Tasks
- [ ] Validate presentation format consistency
- [ ] Verify technical depth preservation
- [ ] Confirm strategic messaging alignment
- [ ] Update presentation index and timing

## Success Criteria

### Content Completeness
- 100% of archived slide content represented in reorganized structure
- No loss of technical specifications or strategic messaging
- All 23 archived slides mapped to reorganized equivalents

### Presentation Quality
- Slides remain presentation-ready (visual-first, minimal text)
- Speaker scripts contain full technical depth
- Appendices provide detailed reference material

### Strategic Impact
- Investor-grade technical depth preserved
- Customer-facing strategic messaging maintained
- Competitive differentiation clearly articulated

## Risk Mitigation

### Content Loss Prevention
- Systematic comparison of archived vs reorganized content
- Detailed mapping of all technical specifications
- Preservation of unique strategic messaging

### Presentation Flow Maintenance
- Logical progression through reorganized structure
- Appropriate timing allocation for enhanced content
- Smooth transitions between slides

### Quality Assurance
