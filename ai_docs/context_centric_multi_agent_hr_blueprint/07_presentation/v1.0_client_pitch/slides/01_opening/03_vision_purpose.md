# SPEAKER SCRIPT

## Mission Introduction (30 seconds)
"Our mission is to transform HR through complete process automation - from hire to retire. But we didn't start by trying to solve everything at once. We started with hiring because it's our most well-defined process with clear stages and measurable outcomes."

## Strategic Rationale (45 seconds)
"Hiring was the logical starting point for three reasons: First, it has the highest impact on organizational success - quality hires drive all other business outcomes. Second, it delivers immediate measurable value within 30 days of implementation. Third, it creates the foundation for all other HR automation - get hiring right, and everything else follows."

## Vision Expansion (15 seconds)
"Our vision is a complete HR automation ecosystem by 2027, where organizations can automate their entire talent lifecycle with the same quality and consistency we've achieved in hiring."
