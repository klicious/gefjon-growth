# SPEAKER SCRIPT

## Crisis Introduction (45 seconds)
"The hiring crisis isn't coming - it's here. 87% of companies struggle to find qualified candidates, and traditional approaches are fundamentally broken. The average time-to-fill has stretched to 42 days, costs have risen to over $4,700 per hire according to SHRM's 2024 report, and nearly half of new hires fail within 18 months."

## Perfect Storm Explanation (45 seconds)
"We're facing a perfect storm: talent shortage is intensifying, the skills gap is widening faster than workforce adaptation, remote work has added complexity to candidate evaluation, and the best candidates have multiple offers. The traditional approach of throwing more people at the problem isn't working - manual processes that worked for 10 candidates per year break down completely at scale."
