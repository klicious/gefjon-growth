# SPEAKER SCRIPT

## Time Reality Check (60 seconds)
"Let me put the manual process in perspective. Your team spends 30-60 minutes just screening each resume - and that includes reviewing repositories and technical background. Add 2-3 hours for interview preparation, 3-4 hours creating assignments for each role, and 1-2 hours synthesizing evaluations. That's 6-10 hours per candidate for thorough evaluation."

## Problem Amplification (30 seconds)
"But time isn't the only issue. Manual processes introduce inconsistency - different interviewers apply different standards. Unconscious bias affects decisions. Under time pressure, teams take quality shortcuts. And worst of all, this doesn't scale - more candidates means proportionally more time, with no efficiency gains."
