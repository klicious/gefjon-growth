**"The Complete Hiring Automation Platform: From Resume to Interview Kit"**

## 7-Stage Pipeline Overview

### **Stage 0: Pre-Flight Validation** ‚úàÔ∏è
- **Environment verification**: System readiness and configuration check
- **Context completeness**: Ensure ‚â•90% of required context is available
- **Quality gates**: Validate data integrity before processing begins
- **Execution logging**: Initialize comprehensive audit trail

### **Stage 1: Context Load & Verification** üß†
- **Automatic discovery**: Find and load all relevant context files
- **Schema validation**: Verify data structure and completeness
- **Missing context identification**: Flag gaps and request additional information
- **Context scoring**: Rate completeness and quality of available information

### **Stage 2: Intake & Normalization** üìã
- **Data consolidation**: Single JSON file with all candidate information
- **Candidate codification**: Transform IDs to secure, trackable codenames
- **Quality assessment**: Evaluate data completeness (‚â•80% threshold)
- **Standardization**: Normalize formats across different data sources

### **Stage 3: JD Mapping & Competency Alignment** üéØ
- **Job description parsing**: Extract requirements and competencies
- **Skills gap analysis**: Compare candidate skills to role requirements
- **Experience validation**: Verify experience level and relevance
- **Confidence scoring**: Rate alignment quality (‚â•75% threshold)

### **Stage 4: Automated Screening** üîç
- **Multi-dimensional scoring**: Evaluate across technical, cultural, and growth dimensions
- **Bias detection**: Systematic identification and mitigation of bias
- **Evidence validation**: Require specific examples for all assessments
- **Decision classification**: Strong Hire (‚â•9.0), Hire (‚â•8.0), Lean Hire (‚â•6.5), No Hire (<6.5)

### **Stage 5: Take-Home Assignment Generation** üìù
- **Conditional generation**: Create assignments for candidates scoring ‚â•8.0/10
- **Personalization engine**: Tailor complexity and focus to candidate background
- **Difficulty calibration**: Match challenge level to experience and role requirements
- **Domain relevance**: Ensure assignments reflect actual job responsibilities

### **Stage 6: Interview Kit Generation** üé§
- **BEI methodology**: Behavioral Event Interview with STAR format questions
- **"Power of Process" approach**: Well-defined understanding of what we want to extract from interviews
- **Value assessment**: Comprehensive evaluation against all 10 company values
- **Personalized questioning**: Tailored questions based on candidate background
- **Scalable generation**: Systematic approach enables AI to create personalized versions at scale
- **Complete materials**: Context briefing, interview guide, and verbatim script

### **Stage 7: Consolidation & Organization** üìÅ
- **Directory structure**: Organized candidate folders with all materials
- **Summary generation**: Executive briefings and decision support documents
- **Audit trail**: Complete processing history and decision rationale
- **Quality verification**: Final validation of all generated materials

## Context-Centric AI Integration

### **The Context Engineering Difference**
Unlike traditional systems that process candidates in isolation, our platform:
- **Loads complete context first**: Company values, role requirements, team dynamics
- **Verifies information completeness**: 90%+ context validation before any processing
- **Ensures consistency**: Same context applied to every candidate evaluation
- **Maintains quality**: Systematic validation at every stage

### **Multi-Agent Orchestration**
Specialized AI agents handle different aspects of the process:
- **Claude Code**: Complex reasoning, analysis, and content generation
- **Gemini CLI**: Workflow orchestration and decision coordination
- **Amazon Q Developer**: Technical assessment and code evaluation
- **KIRO**: Integration management and automation oversight

### **Evidence-Based Processing**
Every decision includes supporting evidence:
- **Specific examples**: All assessments backed by concrete evidence
- **Transparent criteria**: Clear scoring rubrics and decision thresholds
- **Bias detection**: Systematic identification of potential bias
- **Audit capability**: Complete traceability of decision factors

## Production-Ready Outcomes

### **Complete Material Generation**
For every qualified candidate, the system generates:
- **Screening Report**: Comprehensive evaluation with evidence and scoring
- **Take-Home Assignment**: Personalized technical challenge with evaluation criteria
- **Interview Kit**: Complete BEI-focused materials including context, guide, and script
- **Evaluation Framework**: Structured assessment criteria and decision support
- **Communication Templates**: Professional correspondence for all stages

# SPEAKER SCRIPT

## Pipeline Introduction (60 seconds)
"Our 7-stage pipeline transforms hiring from a manual, inconsistent process into an automated, reliable system. Starting with pre-flight validation to ensure system readiness, we then load and verify complete context before processing any candidate. Each stage has specific quality gates and validation requirements, ensuring that only high-quality outputs move to the next stage."

## Context Engineering Emphasis (45 seconds)
"The key differentiator is our context-centric approach. Before processing any candidate, we ensure 90% context completeness. This means the AI has all the information it needs to make informed decisions - company values, role requirements, team dynamics, and candidate background. Better inputs lead to better outputs."

## Multi-Agent Architecture (30 seconds)
"We use specialized AI agents for different aspects - Claude Code for complex reasoning, Gemini CLI for orchestration, Amazon Q Developer for technical assessment, and KIRO for integration management. This multi-agent approach provides redundancy and specialized expertise."

## Production Outcomes (45 seconds)
"The result is complete automation from resume to interview kit. Every qualified candidate gets a comprehensive screening report, personalized take-home assignment, and complete interview materials. No manual work required, and consistent quality across all candidates."
