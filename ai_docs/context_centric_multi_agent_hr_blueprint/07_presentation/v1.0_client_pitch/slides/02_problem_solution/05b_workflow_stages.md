# SPEAKER SCRIPT

## Workflow Overview (60 seconds)
"Our 7-stage automated workflow transforms hiring from a manual, inconsistent process into systematic excellence. We start with pre-flight validation to ensure 90% context completeness. Then we move through candidate screening with comprehensive evaluation, personalized take-home assignment generation, automated assessment, and BEI-focused interview kit creation."

## Quality & Speed (45 seconds)
"Each stage has quality gates and validation requirements, ensuring only high-quality outputs move forward. The entire process - from resume to complete interview materials - takes just 30 minutes.
