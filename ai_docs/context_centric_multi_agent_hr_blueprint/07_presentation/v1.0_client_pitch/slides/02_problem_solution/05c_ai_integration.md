# SPEAKER SCRIPT

## Architecture Overview (60 seconds)
"Our multi-agent AI architecture leverages specialized AI agents for different aspects of the hiring workflow. Claude Code handles complex reasoning and analysis, Gemini CLI orchestrates the overall workflow, Amazon Q Developer manages technical assessments, and KIRO oversees integration management. This specialization ensures each agent operates in its area of expertise."

## Integration Layer (30 seconds)
"The Model Context Protocol integration layer provides research capabilities through Exa with Google Search fallback, structured reasoning through Sequential Thinking, browser automation through Playwright, and content retrieval through Fetch. This creates a robust, fault-tolerant system that continues operating even if individual components fail."
