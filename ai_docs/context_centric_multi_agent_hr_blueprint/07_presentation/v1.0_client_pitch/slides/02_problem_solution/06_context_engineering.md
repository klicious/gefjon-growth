# SLIDE CONTENT

## Headline
**"Context Engineering: Our Competitive Moat"**

## The Difference
• **90%+ context completeness** before processing
• **Company-specific customization** (values, culture, roles)
• **Systematic validation** at every stage
• **Quality gates** prevent incomplete processing

## Why This Matters
**Better Inputs → Better Outputs**

Traditional AI: Generic templates
Our AI: Complete company context

# SPEAKER SCRIPT

## Context Engineering Explanation (60 seconds)
"Context engineering is our secret weapon and primary competitive moat. Before processing any candidate, we ensure 90% context completeness - that means our AI has comprehensive information about your company values, culture, role requirements, team dynamics, and evaluation criteria. This isn't just data collection - it's systematic validation with quality gates at every stage."

## Competitive Advantage (45 seconds)
"While competitors use generic templates and one-size-fits-all approaches, our system is deeply customized to your organization. Better inputs lead to better outputs. This methodology took us months to develop and would be extremely difficult for competitors to replicate. It's why we achieve 8.7/10 quality scores while others struggle with 6.2/10."

## Value Emphasis (15 seconds)
"Context engineering isn't just a feature - it's a fundamental methodology that changes everything about how AI approaches hiring decisions."
