# SPEAKER SCRIPT

## MCP Architecture Overview (75 seconds)
"What makes our system unique is the MCP server integration - that's Model Context Protocol. We have specialized AI agents for different aspects of the workflow. Exa handles advanced research and content discovery, with Google Search as a reliable fallback. Sequential Thinking provides our reasoning engine with step-by-step problem decomposition and logic validation."

## Agent Coordination (45 seconds)
"Playwright handles browser automation for testing and integration, while Fetch manages all HTTP operations and API integrations. The beauty of this architecture is redundancy and specialization - if one agent has issues, others continue working. Each agent is optimized for its specific function, making the entire system more efficient and reliable."
