# SPEAKER SCRIPT

## Scalability Demonstration (75 seconds)
"Our architecture scales seamlessly from startup to enterprise. Whether you're processing 50 candidates a year or 5,000, the system adapts. We use microservices architecture with containerization, so you can scale individual components based on demand. Auto-scaling means you never pay for unused capacity, but you're never limited by system constraints."

## Integration Capabilities (45 seconds)
"Integration with your existing HR tech stack is straightforward. We provide RESTful APIs, webhook support for real-time notifications, and pre-built connectors for major systems like Workday, BambooHR, Slack, and Teams. Our plugin architecture means we can customize the workflow to match your specific processes without rebuilding the core system."
