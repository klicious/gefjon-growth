# SLIDE CONTENT

## Headline
**"Context Engineering in Action"**

## Data Organization
• **Context directory** → Company values, processes, requirements
• **Artifacts/public** → Shareable interview materials
• **Artifacts/private** → Sensitive evaluations and logs
• **Structured hierarchy** → Organized by date and candidate

## Quality Assurance
• **90% context validation** before processing
• **Systematic quality gates** at each stage
• **Complete audit trails** for all decisions
• **Evidence-based assessments** with examples

# SPEAKER SCRIPT

## Data Organization (60 seconds)
"Our context engineering approach requires systematic data organization. We maintain a context directory with company values, processes, and role requirements. Generated materials are organized into public artifacts for shareable interview materials and private artifacts for sensitive evaluations and processing logs. Everything is structured hierarchically by date and candidate for easy access and audit."

## Quality Assurance (30 seconds)
"Quality assurance is built into every stage. We validate 90% context completeness before processing begins, implement systematic quality gates at each stage, maintain complete audit trails for all decisions, and ensure all assessments are evidence-based with specific examples. This systematic approach is what enables our consistent 8.7/10 quality scores."
