# SPEAKER SCRIPT

## Context Engineering (45 seconds)
"Our primary differentiator is context engineering - a proprietary methodology requiring 90% context completeness before processing. This isn't just data collection; it's systematic validation with quality gates at every stage. While competitors use generic templates, we provide company-specific customization at scale. This approach took months to develop and would be extremely difficult for competitors to replicate."

## Security Leadership (30 seconds)
"Second, we built enterprise-grade security from day one, not as an afterthought. We implement privacy by design with automatic data classification, proactive security enhancements, and complete GDPR compliance. This security-first approach means we're ready for enterprise deployment today."

## BEI Excellence (30 seconds)
"Third, our advanced BEI integration uses a 'Power of Process' approach - we have a systematic understanding of what we want to extract from interviews. This enables scalable interview kit generation with evidence-based evaluation using the STAR framework. It's why we can generate personalized, professional-quality interview materials at scale."

## Competitive Summary (15 seconds)
"These three differentiators create sustainable competitive advantages that are difficult for competitors to replicate quickly."
