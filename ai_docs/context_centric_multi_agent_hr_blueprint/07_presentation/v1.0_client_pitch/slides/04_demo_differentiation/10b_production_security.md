We've made proactive security enhancements without external pressure, including private working directories and enhanced data protection. Everything is built with GDPR compliance and complete audit trails."

## Competitive Security Advantage (30 seconds)
"What sets us apart is our proactive approach to security. While competitors bolt on security features when customers demand them, we've built enterprise-grade security from the foundation. This security-first design reduces legal and regulatory risk for our clients and demonstrates our commitment to protecting sensitive hiring data."
