# SPEAKER SCRIPT

## Time Savings Impact (60 seconds)
"The ROI is compelling and immediate. We achieve 97% time reduction - from 6-10 hours per candidate down to just 10-15 minutes. That's not just efficiency, that's transformation. For a mid-size organization processing 50 candidates per year, this translates to 475 hours saved annually, worth $23,750 in direct time savings alone."

## Total Value Calculation (45 seconds)
"But time savings is just the beginning. Quality improvement through consistent evaluation reduces turnover by 15%, saving $150,000 annually. Faster time-to-fill provides $75,000 in opportunity value. The total annual value exceeds $248,000 - that's a 10x return on investment for most organizations."

## Quality Emphasis (15 seconds)
"Remember, we're not just faster - we're better. 8.7/10 quality scores with zero errors means you're getting superior results, not just quicker results."
