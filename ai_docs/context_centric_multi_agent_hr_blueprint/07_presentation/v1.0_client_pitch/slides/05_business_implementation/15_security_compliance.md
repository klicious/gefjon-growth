# SPEAKER SCRIPT

## Security Leadership (60 seconds)
"Security isn't an afterthought for us - it's fundamental to our architecture. We implement privacy by design with automatic data classification, complete GDPR compliance with candidate rights management, and comprehensive audit trails for all decisions. Enterprise encryption protects data at rest and in transit. We're SOC 2, GDPR, and CCPA compliant from day one."

## Proactive Approach (30 seconds)
"Our recent August 12th enhancements demonstrate our proactive security approach - we implemented private working directories for sensitive processing and enhanced data protection without any external pressure or incidents. This continuous improvement mindset means we're always ahead of security requirements, not catching up to them."
