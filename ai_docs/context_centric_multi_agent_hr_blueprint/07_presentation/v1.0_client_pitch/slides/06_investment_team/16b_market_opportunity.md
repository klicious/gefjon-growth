# SPEAKER SCRIPT

## Market Size Opportunity (75 seconds)
"We're addressing a massive market opportunity. The global HR technology market is $240 billion and growing at 12% annually. Our serviceable addressable market - HR automation and AI tools - is $24 billion growing even faster at 15% per year. Our specific target, context-centric automation, represents a $2.4 billion serviceable obtainable market."

## Competitive Positioning (45 seconds)
"What's exciting is the competitive landscape. The market is fragmented with no dominant player in context-centric automation. Traditional ATS systems lack AI sophistication, existing AI tools are mostly point solutions, and there's a quality gap - most competitors prioritize speed over quality and personalization. We're targeting just 1% of our SOM, which gets us to $24 million in revenue - a very achievable goal in this large, growing market."
