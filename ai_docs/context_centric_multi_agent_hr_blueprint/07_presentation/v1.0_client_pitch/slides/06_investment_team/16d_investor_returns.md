## Exit Strategy Overview (75 seconds)
"We see multiple clear exit paths with attractive returns. The primary path is strategic acquisition by HR technology leaders like Workday, enterprise software giants like Microsoft and Oracle, or consulting firms building HR transformation capabilities. Based on comparable transactions, we're targeting 8-12x revenue multiples with a 20-30% strategic premium for our unique technology and market position."

## Return Scenarios (45 seconds)
"Here are the investor return scenarios. In our conservative case with 8x revenue multiple, investors see 8x returns with 24% IRR. Our base case delivers 10x returns with 26% IRR. In the upside scenario with accelerated growth and premium valuation, investors achieve 16x returns with 32% IRR. The IPO path is also viable if we reach $100M+ ARR with strong unit economics by 2029."
