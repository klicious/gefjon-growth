# SPEAKER SCRIPT

## Opening Hook (30 seconds)
"What if I told you we just achieved something unprecedented in hiring automation - 100% of our candidates were hire-eligible in our latest execution? This isn't theoretical anymore. We have a production-ready system with proven results."

## Results Emphasis (60 seconds)
"On August 12th, we processed 3 backend developer candidates in just 30 minutes total - that's 15 minutes of AI processing running in parallel, plus 15 minutes of human review. Compare that to the 6+ hours your team would spend manually, with inconsistent results and potential bias. We achieved an 8.7 out of 10 average quality score with zero errors."

## Investment Ask (30 seconds)
"We're raising $15 million in Series A funding to scale this proven technology. This isn't about building something new - it's about scaling something that already works. Let me show you exactly how we built this system and why it represents the future of hiring."
