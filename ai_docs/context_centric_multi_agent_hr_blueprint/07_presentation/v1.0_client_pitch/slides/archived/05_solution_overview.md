# Slide 5: Solution Overview

## Headline
**"The Complete Hiring Automation Platform: From Resume to Interview Kit"**

## High-Level Workflow: 7-Stage Pipeline

### **Stage 0: Pre-Flight Validation** ‚úàÔ∏è
- **Environment verification**: System readiness and configuration check
- **Context completeness**: Ensure ‚â•90% of required context is available
- **Quality gates**: Validate data integrity before processing begins
- **Execution logging**: Initialize comprehensive audit trail

### **Stage 1: Context Load & Verification** üß†
- **Automatic discovery**: Find and load all relevant context files
- **Schema validation**: Verify data structure and completeness
- **Missing context identification**: Flag gaps and request additional information
- **Context scoring**: Rate completeness and quality of available information

### **Stage 2: Intake & Normalization** üìã
- **Data consolidation**: Single JSON file with all candidate information
- **Candidate codification**: Transform IDs to secure, trackable codenames
- **Quality assessment**: Evaluate data completeness (‚â•80% threshold)
- **Standardization**: Normalize formats across different data sources

### **Stage 3: JD Mapping & Competency Alignment** üéØ
- **Job description parsing**: Extract requirements and competencies
- **Skills gap analysis**: Compare candidate skills to role requirements
- **Experience validation**: Verify experience level and relevance
- **Confidence scoring**: Rate alignment quality (‚â•75% threshold)

### **Stage 4: Automated Screening** üîç
- **Multi-dimensional scoring**: Evaluate across technical, cultural, and growth dimensions
- **Bias detection**: Systematic identification and mitigation of bias
- **Evidence validation**: Require specific examples for all assessments
- **Decision classification**: Strong Hire (‚â•9.0), Hire (‚â•8.0), Lean Hire (‚â•6.5), No Hire (<6.5)

### **Stage 5: Take-Home Assignment Generation** üìù
- **Conditional generation**: Create assignments for candidates scoring ‚â•8.0/10
- **Personalization engine**: Tailor complexity and focus to candidate background
- **Difficulty calibration**: Match challenge level to experience and role requirements
- **Domain relevance**: Ensure assignments reflect actual job responsibilities

### **Stage 6: Interview Kit Generation** üé§
- **BEI methodology**: Behavioral Event Interview with STAR format questions
- **"Power of Process" approach**: Well-defined understanding of what we want to extract from interviews
- **Value assessment**: Comprehensive evaluation against all 10 company values
- **Personalized questioning**: Tailored questions based on candidate background
- **Scalable generation**: Systematic approach enables AI to create personalized versions at scale
- **Complete materials**: Context briefing, interview guide, and verbatim script

### **Stage 7: Consolidation & Organization** üìÅ
- **Directory structure**: Organized candidate folders with all materials
- **Summary generation**: Executive briefings and decision support documents
- **Audit trail**: Complete processing history and decision rationale
- **Quality verification**: Final validation of all generated materials

## Context-Centric AI Integration

### **The Context Engineering Difference**
Unlike traditional systems that process candidates in isolation, our platform:
- **Loads complete context first**: Company values, role requirements, team dynamics
- **Verifies information completeness**: 90%+ context validation before any processing
- **Ensures consistency**: Same context applied to every candidate evaluation
- **Maintains quality**: Systematic validation at every stage

### **Multi-Agent Orchestration**
Specialized AI agents handle different aspects of the process:
- **Claude Code**: Complex reasoning, analysis, and content generation
- **Gemini CLI**: Workflow orchestration and decision coordination
- **Amazon Q Developer**: Technical assessment and code evaluation
- **KIRO**: Integration management and automation oversight

### **Evidence-Based Processing**
Every decision includes supporting evidence:
- **Specific examples**: All assessments backed by concrete evidence
- **Transparent criteria**: Clear scoring rubrics and decision thresholds
- **Bias detection**: Systematic identification of potential bias
- **Audit capability**: Complete traceability of decision factors

## Scalable Architecture

### **Technology Foundation**
- **Language**: Python ‚â•3.12 with modern package management (UV)
- **AI Framework**: Gemini CLI using ReAct methodology (Reason ‚Üí Act ‚Üí Observe ‚Üí Repeat)
- **Data Versioning**: DVC for pipeline state management and reproducibility
- **Version Control**: Git with structured branching and comprehensive code review

### **Integration Capabilities**
- **MCP Server Integration**: Modular protocol for AI agent communication
- **API-First Design**: RESTful APIs for seamless integration
- **Webhook Support**: Real-time notifications and status updates
- **Data Export**: Multiple formats for downstream system integration

### **Security & Compliance**
- **Privacy by Design**: Automatic separation of public deliverables and private logs
- **Data Classification**: Structured storage with appropriate access controls
- **Audit Trails**: Complete processing history for compliance requirements
- **GDPR Compliance**: Built-in data protection and candidate rights management

## Production-Ready Outcomes
