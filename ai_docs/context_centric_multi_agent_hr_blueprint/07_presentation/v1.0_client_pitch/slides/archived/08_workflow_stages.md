## Speaker Notes

### Workflow Overview (60 seconds)
"Our 7-stage pipeline ensures systematic, high-quality processing from resume to interview kit. Each stage has specific quality gates - we don't move to the next stage until the current one meets our standards. This systematic approach is why we achieve 100% success rates."

### Quality Gates Emphasis (45 seconds)
"Notice the quality gates at every stage. 90% context completeness before we start, 80% data quality for normalization, 75% confidence for skills analysis. These aren't arbitrary numbers - they're thresholds we've validated through real-world execution."

### BEI Integration (30 seconds)
"Stage 6 is where our HR expertise really shows. We generate complete Behavioral Event Interview kits using the STAR methodology. These aren't generic questions - they're personalized based on the candidate's background and our company values."

### Production Readiness (45 seconds)
"This isn't a demo or prototype. Every stage has been tested with real candidates making real hiring decisions. The system is production-ready because we built it for production from day one."
