## Speaker Notes

### Differentiator Hierarchy (60 seconds)
"These five differentiators aren't just features - they're sustainable competitive advantages. Context engineering is our primary moat, developed over months and validated through real hiring decisions. While competitors focus on basic screening, we've built a complete, sophisticated system."

### Context Engineering Emphasis (45 seconds)
"Context engineering isn't just a feature - it's a methodology that changes everything. 90% context completeness before processing means our AI has all the information needed for accurate decisions. This systematic approach is why we achieve 8.7/10 quality scores while competitors struggle with 6.2/10."

### Production Readiness (30 seconds)
"Notice that we're not promising future capabilities - we're demonstrating current results. Zero errors, 100% hire-eligible candidates, enterprise-grade security. This is production-ready because we built it for production from day one."

### Competitive Positioning (45 seconds)
"The competitive matrix tells the story. While traditional ATS systems just track candidates and AI screening tools provide basic filtering, we deliver complete end-to-end automation with enterprise-grade quality. Custom development would take 12+ months and require deep expertise we've already built."

## Key Messages
