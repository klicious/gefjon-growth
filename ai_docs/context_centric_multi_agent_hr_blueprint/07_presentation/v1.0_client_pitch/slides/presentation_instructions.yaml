      mission_intro: "Our mission is to transform HR through complete process automation — from hire to retire. But we didn’t start by trying to solve everything at once. We started with hiring because it’s our most well‑defined process with clear stages and measurable outcomes."
      strategic_rationale: "Hiring was the logical starting point for three reasons: First, it has the highest impact on organizational success — quality hires drive all other business outcomes. Second, it delivers immediate measurable value within 30 days of implementation. Third, it creates the foundation for all other HR automation — get hiring right, and everything else follows."
      vision_expansion: "Our vision is a complete HR automation ecosystem by 2027, where organizations can automate their entire talent lifecycle with the same quality and consistency we’ve achieved in hiring."
    intention:
      primary_message: "Show that Gefjon Growth has a clear strategic vision anchored in a logical first use‑case."
      audience_takeaway: "The company is executing a thoughtful long‑term plan, not just selling a hiring tool."

      crisis_intro: "The hiring crisis isn’t coming — it’s here. 87 % of companies struggle to find qualified candidates, and traditional approaches are fundamentally broken. The average time‑to‑fill has stretched to 42 days, costs have risen to more than $4,700 per hire according to SHRM’s 2024 report, and nearly half of new hires fail within 18 months."
      perfect_storm_explanation: "We’re facing a perfect storm: talent shortage is intensifying, the skills gap is widening faster than workforce adaptation, remote work has added complexity to candidate evaluation, and the best candidates have multiple offers. The traditional approach of throwing more people at the problem isn’t working — manual processes that worked for ten candidates per year break down completely at scale."
    intention:
      primary_message: "Traditional hiring processes are broken, and the scale of the crisis demands a new solution."
      audience_takeaway: "There is a pressing, quantitative reason to seek an alternative to manual hiring."
      strategic_purpose: "Build urgency and justify the need for an automated, systematic solution like Gefjon Growth."

      time_reality_check: "Let me put the manual process in perspective. Your team spends 30–60 minutes just screening each resume — and that includes reviewing repositories and technical background. Add 2–3 hours for interview preparation, 3–4 hours creating assignments for each role, and 1–2 hours synthesising evaluations. That’s 6–10 hours per candidate for thorough evaluation."
      problem_amplification: "But time isn’t the only issue. Manual processes introduce inconsistency — different interviewers apply different standards. Unconscious bias affects decisions. Under time pressure, teams take quality shortcuts. And worst of all, this doesn’t scale — more candidates means proportionally more time, with no efficiency gains."
    intention:
      primary_message: "Manual processes consume tremendous time and produce unreliable, biased results."
      audience_takeaway: "The inefficiency and inconsistency of manual hiring make it unsustainable at scale."

      difference:
        - "90 % + context completeness before processing"
        - "Company‑specific customization (values, culture, roles)"
        - "Systematic validation at every stage"
        - "Quality gates prevent incomplete processing"

      progress_stat:
        description: "Place a large progress bar filled to 90 % at the top of the slide. Display ‘90 %+’ above or inside the bar in bold green lettering and label it ‘Context Completeness Required.’"
      flow_diagram:
        description: "Construct a three‑node horizontal flow: Context → AI Processing → Quality Results. Represent each node as a coloured circle with icons (folder for context, CPU for processing, checkmark for results) and connect them with arrows. Annotate beneath the flow that there are systematic validation and quality gates between nodes."
      comparison_chart:
        description: "Include a side‑by‑side bar chart with two groups: Traditional AI and Gefjon AI. Each group has two bars for Context Completeness (generic vs. 90 %+) and Average Quality Score (6.2 vs. 8.7). Use contrasting colours and label axes and title."
      validation_icons:
        description: "Add a row of small icons near the bottom right summarising systematic validation, process stages, protection, and precision."

      context_explanation: "Context engineering is our secret weapon and primary competitive moat. Before processing any candidate, we ensure 90 % context completeness — that means our AI has comprehensive information about your company values, culture, role requirements, team dynamics, and evaluation criteria. This isn’t just data collection — it’s systematic validation with quality gates at every stage."
      competitive_advantage: "While competitors use generic templates and one‑size‑fits‑all approaches, our system is deeply customized to your organization. Better inputs lead to better outputs. This methodology took us months to develop and would be extremely difficult for competitors to replicate. It’s why we achieve 8.7/10 quality scores while others struggle with 6.2/10."
      value_emphasis: "Context engineering isn’t just a feature — it’s a fundamental methodology that changes everything about how AI approaches hiring decisions."
    intention:
      primary_message: "Context engineering is Gefjon Growth’s unique, defensible competitive advantage."
      audience_takeaway: "The systematic approach to context creates superior results that competitors can’t easily match."
      strategic_purpose: "Position Gefjon Growth as having a proprietary moat that underpins its performance and protects its market position."
