# Missing Information Requests (Client + Internal)

Purpose: Enumerate concrete information needed to de-risk the 5‑day demo, pilot scoping, and v1 planning. Please provide answers or pointers to sources. Where not available, we will conduct targeted web research.

## A) Demo (5‑Day) Essentials
1) Target roles for the demo (titles, seniority); pick 1–2 roles.
2) Role competencies and must‑have skills per role (top 6–8), with priority weights.
3) Company values prioritization and weighting for evaluation (e.g., Ownership=0.3, Technical Excellence=0.3, Integrity=0.2, etc.).
4) 2 sample candidate profiles per role (PDF resumes; optionally GitHub links and 1 markdown portfolio each).
5) Any must‑have integrations for the demo (email/calendar/ATS/storage?).
6) Data handling constraints for demo data (redaction expectations, residency requirements, anonymization preference).

## B) Pilot Scope (4–6 Weeks)
1) Expected hiring volumes (candidates/month per role) and roles in scope.
2) Success criteria and KPIs (time‑to‑hire reduction target, interviewer hours saved, quality threshold ≥ 8.5/10, adoption goals).
3) Stakeholder map (Economic Buyer, Champion, Hiring Managers, Security, Legal).
4) Procurement steps and expected timeline (security review, DPA, MSAs, any vendor portal).
5) Required integrations (ATS, SSO, data residency) and environments (sandbox vs prod data).

## C) Compliance & Security
1) Regional data residency requirements (e.g., EU‑only processing?).
2) Retention policies for candidate data (default months, exceptions, deletion triggers).
3) Approved model providers and privacy constraints (no training on customer data, retention windows, logging policies).
4) EEO/legal constraints beyond standard guidance (industry‑specific rules, public sector considerations).
5) Required audit artifacts (log format, export cadence, approver IDs).

## D) Product Configuration
1) Stage weights for evaluation (values_alignment, competencies, experience relevance) and any custom rubrics.
2) Preferred take‑home assessment topics per role and pass/fail gates.
3) Interview formats to include (BEI, system design, pair programming) and timeboxes.
4) Scoring scales (0–5 vs 1–10) and definitions for each level.

## E) Commercials & Pricing Inputs
1) Budget range for pilot and year‑1 subscription.
2) Contract preferences (monthly vs annual, prepay discounts, design partner terms).
3) Willingness‑to‑pay indicators by segment (if any prior data exists).

## F) Evidence/References (to attach if available)
- Current interview guides, rubrics, or values handbooks.
- Security questionnaire templates and DPA redlines.
- Any prior analytics on time‑to‑hire or interviewer hours.

## Notes
- This list complements the open items recorded in 10_open_questions/decision_log.md.
- We will proceed with safe defaults in the absence of inputs, but demo quality and fit improve significantly with the above information.
