## Critical Problem Identified

The current hiring process for Gefjon Growth's platform engineering transition has revealed fundamental misalignment between assessment methods and role requirements. The case of candidate **Phoenix_005 (Park Juyoung)** exposed critical gaps:

- **Traditional coding skills assessment failed** to predict AI-assisted development capability
- **Take-home assignments completed with AI assistance** but candidate unable to execute without AI support
- **Conflict between coding ability vs. AI orchestration skills** in role requirements
- **4x-25x performance goals** requiring new competency frameworks

## Strategic Context

Gefjon Growth is transitioning from **Software Engineering Team → Platform Engineering Team**, fundamentally changing role requirements:

### Traditional Software Engineer Focus:
- Write high-quality code independently
- Deep technical implementation skills
- Individual contributor performance

### Platform Engineer Focus (AI-Assisted):
- **Orchestrate AI agents** for 4x-25x performance improvement
- **Systems thinking and architecture** over implementation
- **AI collaboration and critical evaluation** skills
- **Platform reliability and scalability** focus

## Research-Based Findings

### Industry Trends (2024-2025):
- **84% of developers** use AI tools, but only **60% view them favorably**
- **26% productivity improvement** documented with AI coding assistants
- **Critical thinking and system design** now prioritized over pure coding skills
- **Mixed results**: Some studies show **19% slower performance** with AI tools for experienced developers

### Key Competency Shifts:
1. **Logical Thinking** → AI instruction and validation capability
2. **Problem Identification** → Gap analysis and system optimization
3. **Data-Driven Decisions** → AI output evaluation and iteration
4. **Continuous Learning** → AI tool mastery and adaptation
5. **Coding Skills** → Architecture and AI guidance capability

## Proposed Solution Framework

### 1. Multi-Tier Assessment Model
- **Tier 1**: AI-Assisted Development Simulation
- **Tier 2**: Critical Thinking & System Design
- **Tier 3**: AI Orchestration & Platform Architecture

### 2. Competency-Based Evaluation
- Replace binary coding tests with **AI collaboration assessments**
- Focus on **architectural thinking** and **production system design**
- Emphasize **continuous learning aptitude** and **adaptability**

### 3. Performance Prediction Model
- **AI Effectiveness Scoring**: Ability to produce quality outputs using AI
- **System Design Capability**: Platform and architecture thinking
- **Learning Velocity**: Adaptation to new AI tools and methodologies

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Assessment Redesign (4 weeks)
- Develop AI-assisted technical challenges
- Create system design simulation environments
- Build competency evaluation frameworks

### Phase 2: Pilot Testing (6 weeks)  
- Test new assessment methods on known-good candidates
- Validate predictive accuracy of new metrics
- Refine scoring algorithms

### Phase 3: Full Deployment (2 weeks)
- Integrate into existing hiring pipeline
- Train interview team on new methods
- Monitor and optimize results

## Expected Outcomes

### Immediate Benefits:
- **Better role-fit prediction** for platform engineering positions
- **Reduced false negatives** for AI-capable candidates
- **Improved hiring efficiency** and time-to-productivity

### Long-term Impact:
- **4x-25x performance gains** through optimized team composition
- **Future-ready hiring process** aligned with AI-assisted development
- **Competitive advantage** in platform engineering talent acquisition

## Risk Mitigation

- **Maintain backward compatibility** with traditional assessment methods during transition
- **Continuous validation** of new assessment effectiveness
- **Regular calibration** against actual job performance outcomes
