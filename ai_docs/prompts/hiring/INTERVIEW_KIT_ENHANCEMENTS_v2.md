# Interview Kit Generation Workflow - v2.0 Enhancements

## Overview
This document summarizes the major enhancements made to the interview kit generation workflow, incorporating lessons learned from the Park Juyoung candidate assessment.

## Key Problems Solved

### 1. **Duplicate Assessment Issue**
- **Problem**: BEI and technical portions were testing the same competencies
- **Solution**: Clear separation - BEI for behavioral values, pair programming for technical skills

### 2. **Limited Technical Assessment Depth**  
- **Problem**: Traditional Q&A couldn't assess production engineering practices
- **Solution**: Custom pair programming tasks with skeleton projects targeting specific gaps

### 3. **Generic BEI Questions**
- **Problem**: Questions weren't exploring candidate's missing core values  
- **Solution**: Systematic core value gap analysis with targeted behavioral exploration

## Major Enhancements

### 🔄 **Workflow Separation**
```
Previous: BEI + Technical Q&A (overlapping assessment)
Enhanced: BEI (behavioral) + Pair Programming (technical) (zero overlap)
```

### 📊 **Core Value Gap Analysis**
- **PROVEN**: Clear evidence in background → Light validation
- **SUGGESTED**: Some evidence → Moderate probing  
- **MISSING**: No evidence → Deep behavioral exploration

### 🧪 **Custom Pair Programming Generation**
- Analyzes candidate's technical gaps from take-home/background
- Generates targeted skeleton project with production focus
- Creates working codebase with strategic TODO markers
- Includes comprehensive setup documentation

### 🎯 **Experience-Based BEI Questions**
- General behavioral questions drawing from full career
- STAR method focused with deep follow-up probes
- No technical implementation questions (moved to pair programming)

## New Command Structure

### **Enhanced v2.0 (Recommended):**
```bash
gemini run \
  --prompt "ai_docs/prompts/hiring/generate_interview_kit_prompt_v2.md" \
  --context "data/public/hiring/resume/[candidate_file].json"
```

### **Legacy v1.0 (Still supported):**
```bash
gemini run \
  --prompt "ai_docs/prompts/hiring/generate_interview_kit_prompt.md" \
  --context "data/public/hiring/resume/[candidate_file].json"
```

## Assessment Framework Enhancement

### **BEI Focus Areas (40 minutes)**
Target missing core values through general behavioral questions:
- Customer-Centric Craftsmanship
- Ownership & Proactivity  
- Data-Informed Iteration
- Integrity & Reliability (behavioral aspects)
- Continuous Learning & Mentorship
- Innovative Spirit

### **Technical Assessment (45 minutes)**
Production engineering competency through pair programming:
- Technical Excellence & Scalable Elegance
- Security & Compliance First
- Observability & Guardrails  
- Integrity & Reliability (technical aspects)

## Benefits

### **⏱️ Time Efficiency**
- No duplicate assessment between BEI and technical portions
- Strategic time allocation based on identified gaps
- Clear transitions between interview segments

### **🎯 Assessment Quality**
- Deeper behavioral exploration of missing values
- Hands-on technical assessment of production practices
- Better signal-to-noise ratio in evaluation

### **🔧 Interviewer Experience**
- Clear separation of concerns for different interviewers
- Complete skeleton projects ready for immediate use
- Structured scoring framework for consistent evaluation

### **📈 Candidate Experience**
- More realistic technical assessment through collaborative coding
- Opportunity to demonstrate thinking process, not just knowledge
- Clear structure and expectations

## Migration Path

1. **Immediate**: Use v2.0 for new candidates
2. **Gradual**: Migrate existing candidates to v2.0 format as needed
3. **Legacy Support**: v1.0 remains functional for existing workflows

## Success Metrics

- **Assessment Accuracy**: Better prediction of on-job performance
- **Interview Efficiency**: Reduced time to decision with higher confidence
- **Candidate Satisfaction**: More engaging and realistic technical assessment
- **Interviewer Confidence**: Clearer evaluation criteria and process

## Next Steps

1. **Validation**: Test v2.0 with upcoming candidates
2. **Iteration**: Refine based on interviewer feedback
3. **Training**: Update interviewer training materials
4. **Metrics**: Track assessment quality improvements
