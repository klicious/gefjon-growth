## 7. Key Methodology Shifts

### **From Traditional Software Engineering Assessment:**
- Independent coding ability → AI orchestration and collaboration
- Algorithm implementation → Systems thinking and architecture  
- Individual problem solving → Platform and production thinking
- Static skill evaluation → Learning agility and adaptation capability

### **Platform Engineering Focus Areas:**
- **AI Collaboration**: Primary skill for 4x-25x performance improvement
- **Systems Thinking**: Essential for platform architecture and reliability
- **Production Mindset**: Operational excellence and scalability focus
- **Continuous Learning**: Adaptation to rapidly evolving AI landscape

### **Assessment Philosophy:**
The question isn't whether candidates can code without AI, but whether they can think systemically, design robust platforms, orchestrate AI agents effectively, and continuously adapt to achieve exceptional results in an AI-assisted development environment.

This enhanced approach ensures comprehensive evaluation of platform engineering potential while maximizing interview efficiency and predictive accuracy for AI-assisted development success.
