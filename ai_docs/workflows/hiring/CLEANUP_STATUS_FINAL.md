### Primary Workflow Execution
```bash
# Use the main orchestrator (no more "enhanced" prefix)
gemini run --prompt "ai_docs/workflows/hiring/orchestrator.md"

# Use the primary configuration
gemini run --config "ai_docs/workflows/hiring/config/workflow_config.yaml"

# Run complete integration
python scripts/complete_workflow_integration.py
```

### Key Benefits
1. **No Confusion**: Clear primary file names without version suffixes
2. **Single Source of Truth**: One definitive version of each component
3. **Complete Materials**: All candidate directories fully populated
4. **Production Ready**: All workflows tested and verified

## 🔍 Verification Results

### ✅ Passed Checks
