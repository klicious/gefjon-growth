# Hiring Workflow Archive

This directory contains archived versions of the hiring workflow as it evolved to support the hybrid BEI + Enhanced Technical Assessment methodology.

## Archive Structure

### `legacy_v1.0/` (Archived 2025-09-02)
- **Original workflow** before hybrid methodology implementation
- **Core focus**: Platform engineering competency assessment without hybrid scoring
- **Assessment structure**: Standard technical evaluation with basic BEI integration
- **File structure**: Original task-based workflow organization

**Key characteristics of v1.0**:
- Platform engineering focus with 4-category competency framework
- Basic BEI integration without systematic hybrid scoring
- Technical assessment without AI-assisted development emphasis
- Single-tier evaluation without weighted scoring combination

### Migration to Hybrid v2.0 (Current)
The workflow was enhanced to implement the **Hybrid BEI + Enhanced Technical Assessment** framework:

#### What Was Preserved
- All workflow task structure and organization
- Platform engineering competency assessment approach
- BEI methodology and STAR format questions
- Quality assurance and validation frameworks

#### What Was Enhanced
- **Hybrid Scoring Integration**: 60% BEI Core Values + 40% Enhanced Technical Assessment
- **AI-Assisted Development Focus**: Emphasis on AI collaboration capability
- **Systematic Core Values Assessment**: All 10 values with PROVEN/SUGGESTED/MISSING framework
- **Enhanced Technical Evaluation**: AI instruction effectiveness, output validation, collaboration iteration
- **Platform Engineering Scenarios**: Systems thinking and production mindset assessment

#### Key Workflow Changes
1. **Interview Kit Generation (Task 6)**: Updated to generate hybrid assessment materials
2. **Technical Assessment Integration**: Added AI-assisted development simulation
3. **Scoring Framework**: Implemented 75-point hybrid scoring system
4. **Decision Matrix**: Updated thresholds for Strong Hire/Hire/Lean Hire/No Hire

## Usage Notes

### Accessing Legacy Files
If you need to reference the original workflow approach:
```bash
# View legacy orchestrator
cat ai_docs/workflows/hiring/archive/legacy_v1.0/orchestrator.md

# Access legacy task files
ls ai_docs/workflows/hiring/archive/legacy_v1.0/tasks/
```

### Migration Command History
The following transformations were applied during migration:
1. Archived all original files to `legacy_v1.0/`
2. Updated orchestrator with hybrid methodology references
3. Enhanced Task 6 (Interview Kit Generation) with hybrid assessment
4. Integrated hybrid scoring framework throughout workflow
5. Updated all documentation references to hybrid approach

## Hybrid Framework Benefits

The enhanced workflow maintains all the strengths of the platform engineering focus while addressing the critical gap identified in the Phoenix_005 case:

- **Cultural Alignment Preserved**: 60% weight ensures core values remain primary
- **Technical Assessment Enhanced**: 40% weight properly evaluates AI collaboration
- **Systematic Evaluation**: Evidence-based assessment of all competencies
- **Decision Framework**: Clear thresholds prevent cultural/technical trade-offs

## Rollback Capability

If needed, the legacy workflow can be restored from this archive:
```bash
# Restore legacy workflow (NOT RECOMMENDED without hybrid framework benefits)
cp -r archive/legacy_v1.0/* ../
```

However, rolling back would lose the hybrid methodology benefits and return to the Phoenix_005 assessment gap.
