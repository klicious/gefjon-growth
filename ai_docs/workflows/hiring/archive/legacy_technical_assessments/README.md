# Legacy Technical Assessment Archive

This directory contains the previous technical assessment templates that have been replaced by the new **AI-Assisted Technical Assessment Framework**.

## Archived Components

### `pair_programming/` (Archived 2025-09-02)
- **easy.md**: Basic programming challenges for junior candidates
- **intermediate.md**: Mid-level technical problems
- **expert.md**: Advanced system design and implementation tasks

**Legacy Approach Characteristics**:
- Independent coding without AI assistance
- Traditional algorithmic problem-solving focus
- LeetCode-style challenges that generative models can easily solve
- Limited real-world engineering problem simulation
- No evaluation of AI collaboration skills

## Migration to AI-Assisted Framework

The legacy templates have been replaced by a comprehensive AI-assisted technical assessment framework that addresses critical gaps in modern development evaluation:

### What Was Replaced
- **Independent Coding Tests**: Traditional programming challenges without AI tools
- **Algorithmic Puzzles**: LeetCode-style problems that don't reflect real work
- **Isolated Problem Solving**: Assessment without collaboration tools or realistic constraints
- **Static Difficulty Levels**: Rigid easy/intermediate/expert categorization

### What Was Enhanced
- **AI Collaboration Evaluation**: Assessment of prompt engineering and AI partnership
- **Real-World Engineering Problems**: Scenarios requiring human judgment beyond code generation
- **Iterative Problem Solving**: Tasks necessitating prompt refinement and AI output validation
- **Production-Ready Thinking**: Security, observability, and maintainability requirements
- **Core Values Integration**: Technical assessment aligned with company values

## New AI-Assisted Assessment Framework

Located at: `context/hr_processes/ai_assisted_technical_assessment_framework.yaml`

### Key Improvements
1. **Modern Development Reality**: Evaluates AI-assisted development as the new standard
2. **Human Judgment Focus**: Problems requiring understanding beyond code generation
3. **Phoenix_005 Gap Resolution**: Properly assesses candidates who excel with AI collaboration
4. **Core Values Alignment**: Technical assessment integrated with behavioral evaluation
5. **Structured Scoring**: 25-point framework integrated with hybrid assessment

### Sample Assessment Tasks
- **API Enhancement**: OAuth 2.0, logging, metrics implementation with AI assistance
- **Code Refactoring**: AI-generated code improvement and maintainability
- **Architecture Design**: Scalable system design with AI research and validation
- **Live Issue Debugging**: Production problem resolution with AI collaboration
- **Prompt Engineering**: Direct evaluation of AI instruction effectiveness

## Why the Change Was Necessary

### Phoenix_005 Case Study
The legacy framework failed to properly evaluate Phoenix_005 (Park Juyoung), who:
- **Failed traditional coding tests** without AI assistance
- **Excelled at take-home assignments** using AI tools effectively
- **Demonstrated strong learning agility** and platform engineering potential
- **Would have been missed** as a quality hire under the old system

### Industry Evolution
- **AI-Assisted Development** is now the standard in modern engineering teams
- **Collaboration with AI tools** is a critical skill for platform engineers
- **Traditional coding tests** no longer reflect actual job performance
- **Real-world problems** require more than independent algorithmic thinking

## Rollback Capability

If needed (NOT RECOMMENDED), legacy templates can be accessed from this archive:
```bash
# View legacy templates (for reference only)
ls ai_docs/workflows/hiring/archive/legacy_technical_assessments/pair_programming/

# Legacy easy template
cat ai_docs/workflows/hiring/archive/legacy_technical_assessments/pair_programming/easy.md
```

**Warning**: Rolling back to legacy templates would:
- Lose AI collaboration assessment capability
- Return to Phoenix_005 assessment gap
- Misalign with modern development practices
- Reduce hiring accuracy for platform engineering roles

## Success Metrics Comparison

### Legacy Framework Results
- High false negative rate for AI-capable candidates
- Misalignment with actual job performance requirements
- Limited evaluation of real-world engineering skills
- Phoenix_005 type candidates systematically excluded

### New Framework Benefits
- Proper assessment of AI collaboration skills
- Alignment with modern platform engineering practices
- Phoenix_005 would now achieve 76% technical score (19/25 points)
- Better correlation with job performance and team success
