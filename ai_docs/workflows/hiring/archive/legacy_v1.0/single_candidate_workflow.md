# Single Candidate Workflow

## Overview
This workflow maintains a single version of results for each candidate, eliminating duplicate files and providing a clean, organized structure for the hiring process.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Single Directory Per Candidate
- Each candidate gets one consolidated directory: `{candidate_id}_{normalized_name}`
- All materials for a candidate are stored in their dedicated directory
- No more scattered files across multiple locations

### 2. Standardized Subdirectory Structure
```
artifacts/public/hiring/candidates/{date}_consolidated/
â”œâ”€â”€ {candidate_id}_{normalized_name}/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ screening/           # Screening reports and evaluations
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ takehome/           # Take-home assignments and evaluations
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ interview/          # Interview materials and guides
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ evaluation/         # Final evaluations and decisions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ communication/      # Email templates and correspondence
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ candidate_summary.md # Individual candidate overview
```

### 3. Automated Consolidation
- Script automatically moves existing files to appropriate subdirectories
- Generates individual candidate summaries
- Creates comprehensive hiring summary with all key data
