# Single Candidate Hybrid Workflow
## BEI Core Values + Enhanced Technical Assessment

## Overview
This workflow implements the **Hybrid BEI + Enhanced Technical Assessment** methodology, maintaining a single version of results for each candidate with comprehensive evaluation combining traditional behavioral assessment (60% weight) and enhanced technical evaluation (40% weight). Provides a clean, organized structure for the complete hiring process while preserving organizational DNA and addressing technical assessment gaps.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Single Directory Per Candidate
- Each candidate gets one consolidated directory: `{candidate_id}_{normalized_name}`
- All materials for a candidate are stored in their dedicated directory
- No more scattered files across multiple locations

### 2. Standardized Subdirectory Structure
```
artifacts/public/hiring/candidates/{date}_consolidated/
â”œâ”€â”€ {candidate_id}_{normalized_name}/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ screening/           # Screening reports and evaluations
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ takehome/           # Take-home assignments and evaluations
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ interview/          # Interview materials and guides
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ evaluation/         # Final evaluations and decisions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ communication/      # Email templates and correspondence
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ candidate_summary.md # Individual candidate overview
```

### 3. Automated Consolidation
- Script automatically moves existing files to appropriate subdirectories
- Generates individual candidate summaries
- Creates comprehensive hiring summary with all key data

python scripts/consolidate_hybrid_hiring_results.py

# Generate complete hybrid materials for all candidates
python scripts/generate_hybrid_candidate_materials.py

# Generate overall hybrid assessment summary  
python scripts/generate_hybrid_overall_summary.py
```

### Access Candidate Information
Navigate to: `artifacts/public/hiring/candidates/20250811_consolidated/{candidate_id}_{name}/`

Each directory now contains:
- **Complete hybrid screening analysis** with core values and technical assessment
- **Customized take-home assignments** based on experience level with AI collaboration focus
- **Comprehensive hybrid interview materials** ready for BEI + enhanced technical evaluation
- **Hybrid evaluation frameworks** for 75-point decision tracking (50 BEI + 25 technical)

## File Naming Conventions

- **Screening**: `screening_report.md`
- **Take-home**: `takehome_assignment.md`, `takehome_evaluation.md`
- **Interview**: `candidate_context.md`, `interview_guide.md`, `interview_script.md`
