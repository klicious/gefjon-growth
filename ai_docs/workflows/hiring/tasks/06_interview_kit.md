# Task 6: BEI-Focused Interview Kit Generation

**Purpose**: Generate comprehensive Behavioral Event Interview (BEI) materials that systematically assess all 10 company core values through past behavioral pattern analysis, ensuring thorough evaluation of candidate-value alignment while maintaining personalized interview experience.

## Prerequisites
- **Tasks 1-5 Completed**: All previous stages successful
- **Input**: `data/private/hiring/working/{run_id}/candidates.normalized.json`
- **Context**: Company values, job requirements, candidate profiles, screening reports, take-home evaluations
- **Approval**: Platform Lead approval for take-home evaluations

## BEI Methodology Overview

### Core Principles
1. **Past Behavior Predicts Future Performance**: Focus on specific past experiences, not hypothetical scenarios
2. **STAR Format Structure**: Every question follows Situation-Task-Action-Results framework
3. **Evidence-Based Assessment**: Map concrete evidence from candidate materials to core values
4. **Gap Analysis**: Distinguish between values that need verification vs. discovery
5. **Pattern Recognition**: Multiple questions per value to confirm behavioral consistency

### Value Evidence Categorization
- **PROVEN**: Strong, clear evidence from resume/materials (verify authenticity)
- **SUGGESTED**: Weak or indirect evidence (probe deeper for confirmation)
- **MISSING**: No evidence found (comprehensive discovery needed)

## Objectives
- **Primary**: Systematically assess all 10 core values through BEI methodology
- Generate personalized interview materials for each eligible candidate
- Create executive briefings with comprehensive BEI value gap analysis
- Develop detailed interview guides with value-by-value BEI questions
- Produce verbatim scripts with STAR format questions and follow-ups

## Pre-Generation Analysis Requirements

### Required Inputs
```yaml
required_inputs:
  - candidate_resume_data: "Complete profile from candidates JSON"
  - screening_report: "Detailed screening analysis and scores"
  - takehome_materials: "Assignment and any provided work samples"
  - job_description: "Role requirements and competency expectations"
  - company_values: "10 core values with behavioral indicators"
```

### Value Evidence Mapping Process
For each of the 10 core values, analyze and document:

#### 1. Technical Excellence & Scalable Elegance
- **Evidence Sources**: Technical projects, architecture decisions, code quality practices
- **Key Indicators**: System design, performance optimization, maintainability focus
- **Red Flags**: Shortcuts without consideration for scale, poor architectural decisions

#### 2. Customer-Centric Craftsmanship
- **Evidence Sources**: User-focused projects, usability considerations, stakeholder engagement
- **Key Indicators**: User research, feedback incorporation, end-user problem solving
- **Red Flags**: Technology-first thinking, no user validation, internal-only focus

#### 3. Ownership & Proactivity
- **Evidence Sources**: Leadership examples, initiative-taking, problem resolution
- **Key Indicators**: Going beyond assigned tasks, taking responsibility for outcomes
- **Red Flags**: Blame-shifting, waiting for direction, avoiding difficult decisions

#### 4. Observability & Guardrails
- **Evidence Sources**: Monitoring implementation, testing practices, operational excellence
- **Key Indicators**: Metrics-driven development, proactive monitoring, incident response
- **Red Flags**: No testing strategy, reactive-only approach, blind deployment

#### 5. Data-Informed Iteration
- **Evidence Sources**: A/B testing, metrics analysis, decision-making processes
- **Key Indicators**: Evidence-based decisions, measurement focus, iterative improvement
- **Red Flags**: Gut-feeling decisions, no measurement, resistance to data

#### 6. Integrity & Reliability
- **Evidence Sources**: Ethical decision-making, reliability in commitments, quality focus
- **Key Indicators**: Honesty in difficult situations, consistent delivery, quality focus
- **Red Flags**: Cutting corners, unreliable commitments, ethical compromises

#### 7. Security & Compliance First
- **Evidence Sources**: Security practices, compliance awareness, risk management
- **Key Indicators**: Security-by-design thinking, compliance integration, risk awareness
- **Red Flags**: Security afterthought, compliance ignorance, unnecessary risk-taking

#### 8. Collaboration & Knowledge-Sharing
- **Evidence Sources**: Team projects, mentoring, documentation, knowledge transfer
- **Key Indicators**: Effective teamwork, teaching others, accessible documentation
- **Red Flags**: Hoarding knowledge, poor communication, team conflict

#### 9. Continuous Learning & Mentorship
- **Evidence Sources**: Skill development, teaching others, staying current
- **Key Indicators**: Learning new technologies, helping teammates grow, industry engagement
- **Red Flags**: Stagnant skills, reluctance to teach, outdated practices

#### 10. Innovative Spirit
- **Evidence Sources**: Creative problem-solving, new approaches, experimentation
- **Key Indicators**: Novel solutions, willingness to try new approaches, creative thinking
- **Red Flags**: Always status-quo, fear of new approaches, no creative solutions

## BEI Question Framework

### STAR Question Structure Template
```
"Tell me about a specific time when you [behavioral indicator]. 
- What was the SITUATION you were in?
- What was your specific TASK or challenge?
- What ACTIONS did you personally take?
- What were the RESULTS, and what did you learn?"
```

### Sample STAR Questions by Value

#### Technical Excellence & Scalable Elegance
**Verification Question** (when evidence exists):
"I see from your resume you worked on [specific project]. Tell me about a time when you had to make a technical decision that would impact the system's ability to scale. What was the situation, what options did you consider, what actions did you take, and what were the results?"

**Discovery Question** (when evidence missing):
"Describe a specific situation where you had to choose between a quick solution and a more elegant, scalable approach. Walk me through your thought process, the decision you made, and the outcome."

#### Ownership & Proactivity
**Verification Question**:
"You mentioned leading [specific initiative]. Tell me about a time when you took ownership of a problem that wasn't specifically assigned to you. What drove you to take action, what did you do, and what happened as a result?"

**Discovery Question**:
"Give me an example of when you saw something going wrong in a project or system, even though it wasn't technically your responsibility. How did you handle it?"
