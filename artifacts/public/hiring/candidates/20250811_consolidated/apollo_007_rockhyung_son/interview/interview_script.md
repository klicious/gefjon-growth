## Interview Script

### Opening & BEI Introduction (10 minutes)

**Interviewer**: "Hi RockHyung, thank you for joining us today. I'm [Name], [Title] at Gefjon Growth. How are you doing today?"

*[Brief company overview - 2-3 minutes]*

**BEI Introduction**:
"Today we'll be using a structured interview approach called BEI - Behavioral Event Interviewing. I'll be asking you about specific situations from your past experience, and I'm looking for detailed examples using the STAR method - Situation, Task, Action, and Results. The idea is that past behavior is the best predictor of future performance."

"We'll spend about 60 minutes on behavioral questions covering our core values, then 30 minutes on technical discussion, and wrap up with your questions. Does that sound good?"

### BEI Core Values Assessment (60 minutes)
