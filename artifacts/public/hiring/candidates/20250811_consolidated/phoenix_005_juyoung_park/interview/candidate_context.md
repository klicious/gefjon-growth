# Candidate Context & Value Gap Analysis

Candidate: Juyoung Park (phoenix_005_juyoung_park)
Repository for review: https://github.com/jyp-on/dunamis

## Executive Briefing
- **Summary**: Juyoung's initial screening was strong (8.5/10), but the take-home evaluation resulted in a "Lean Hire" (6.4/10). While the submission shows a foundational understanding of software architecture (e.g., using a base class for extensibility), it has significant gaps in production-readiness, particularly in testing, security, and resilience.
- **Role Fit**: The candidate demonstrates potential but may require significant mentorship to meet our engineering standards. The interview must rigorously assess whether these gaps are due to lack of experience or a lack of depth in understanding.
- **Experience Highlights**:
    - Initial screening highlighted high-scale system experience and CI/CD expertise.
    - Take-home demonstrated basic application of OOP principles for extensibility.
- **Risks to Probe**:
    - **Testing Depth**: Project lacks integration, contract, or E2E tests.
    - **Security Practices**: No secret management or dependency scanning was evident.
    - **Resilience**: Implemented a basic timeout but no retry logic or circuit breakers.
    - **Production Readiness**: No CI pipeline, containerization, or linting was configured.

## Core Values Mapping (PROVEN / SUGGESTED / MISSING)

- **Technical Excellence & Scalable Elegance**: **SUGGESTED** — Evidence: The use of an abstract base class in `src/exchanges/base.py` is a good architectural choice. However, the lack of resilience patterns (retries, circuit breakers) and performance testing are significant gaps.
- **Customer-Centric Craftsmanship**: **MISSING** — Evidence: The absence of a defined API contract (like OpenAPI) suggests a potential gap in thinking about the developer experience of API consumers.
- **Ownership & Proactivity**: **MISSING** — Evidence: The submission met the bare minimum requirements but did not demonstrate proactivity by adding robust testing, CI, or other production-readiness features, which is reflected in the low "Going Above and Beyond" score.
- **Observability & Guardrails**: **SUGGESTED** — Evidence: The implementation of structured logging in `src/utils/logger.py` is a positive signal. However, this is offset by the lack of metrics, health endpoints, or a CI/linting pipeline.
- **Data-Informed Iteration**: **MISSING** — Evidence: Not directly testable in the take-home assignment.
- **Integrity & Reliability**: **MISSING** — Evidence: While a unit test for the logger exists, the complete lack of integration or contract tests for the core exchange client logic is a critical gap in ensuring reliability.
- **Security & Compliance First**: **SUGGESTED** — Evidence: The presence of input validation methods (`_validate_*`) in `src/exchanges/base.py` is good. However, the absence of any secret management for API keys is a major security concern.
- **Collaboration & Knowledge-Sharing**: **SUGGESTED** — Evidence: The repository includes a `README.md` with setup instructions. However, it lacks API documentation.
- **Continuous Learning & Mentorship**: **MISSING** — Evidence: Not directly testable in the take-home assignment.
- **Innovative Spirit**: **MISSING** — Evidence: Not directly testable in the take-home assignment.

## Interview Strategy
- **Priorities**: The primary goal is to understand the "why" behind the gaps in the take-home project. We need to determine if the candidate has the theoretical knowledge but lacked time, or if there are fundamental gaps in their understanding of production-grade engineering. Key values to probe are `Integrity & Reliability` (testing), `Security & Compliance`, and `Technical Excellence` (resilience).
- **Time allocation**: 40 minutes BEI (focused on take-home), 40 minutes technical deep-dive on the code, 10 minutes candidate Q&A. Total 90 minutes.
