# Refactored Interview Script - Park Juyoung

**Candidate**: Juyoung Park (phoenix_005_juyoung_park)  
**Structure**: BEI (40 mins) + Pair Programming (45 mins) + Q&A (5 mins) = 90 minutes total

**Key Change**: Technical competency will be assessed through pair programming. BEI focuses purely on behavioral demonstration of missing core values through past experiences.

---

## Part 1: Introduction & Warm-up (5 mins)

**Interviewer**: "Hi Juyoung, thanks for joining us today. We'll structure our time in three parts: first, some behavioral questions about your past experiences, then we'll do some collaborative coding together, and finally time for your questions. Let's start by getting to know your background better."

**Transition Question**: "Can you walk me through your engineering journey so far? What drew you to software development, and what kinds of projects have you worked on?"

---

## Part 2: BEI - Core Values Exploration (40 mins)

*Focus on MISSING values: Customer-Centric Craftsmanship, Ownership & Proactivity, Data-Informed Iteration, Integrity & Reliability (behavioral), Continuous Learning & Mentorship, Innovative Spirit*

### Customer-Centric Craftsmanship (8 mins)

**Question 1**: "Tell me about a time when you had to build something for users you didn't fully understand at first. How did you go about understanding their needs?"
- **Probe for Situation**: What was the project? Who were the users?
- **Probe for Task**: What was your role? What challenge did you face?
- **Probe for Action**: How did you gather user feedback? Did you change your approach based on what you learned?
- **Probe for Result**: How did the final solution differ from your initial assumptions? What was the user response?

**Question 2**: "Describe a time when you had to make a technical decision that would significantly impact how others would use or interact with your code/system."
- **Probe for Action**: How did you think about the developer/user experience? What trade-offs did you consider?
- **Probe for Result**: How did your decision affect others? What feedback did you get?

### Ownership & Proactivity (8 mins)

**Question 3**: "Tell me about a project or system where you went above and beyond the basic requirements. What motivated you to do more than what was asked?"
- **Probe for Situation**: What were the original requirements?
- **Probe for Task**: What did you identify as missing or could be improved?
- **Probe for Action**: What additional work did you do? How did you prioritize it?
- **Probe for Result**: What was the impact? How was it received?

**Question 4**: "Describe a situation where you noticed a problem that wasn't directly your responsibility, but you decided to address it anyway."
- **Probe for Action**: Why did you choose to get involved? How did you approach it?
- **Probe for Result**: What happened? Would you do anything differently?

### Data-Informed Iteration (8 mins)

**Question 5**: "Tell me about a time when you made a decision based on data or metrics rather than intuition. What was the situation?"
- **Probe for Situation**: What decision needed to be made?
- **Probe for Action**: What data did you collect? How did you analyze it?
- **Probe for Result**: How did the data influence your decision? What was the outcome?

**Question 6**: "Describe a time when you had to measure the success of something you built. How did you define success and track it?"
- **Probe for Action**: What metrics did you choose and why? How did you collect the data?
- **Probe for Result**: What did you learn? Did you iterate based on the results?

### Integrity & Reliability (Behavioral) (8 mins)

**Question 7**: "Tell me about a time when you discovered a significant bug or issue in production. How did you handle it?"
- **Probe for Situation**: How severe was the issue? Who was affected?
- **Probe for Action**: What was your immediate response? How did you communicate about it?
- **Probe for Result**: How did you prevent similar issues in the future?

**Question 8**: "Describe a situation where you had to deliver something under tight time pressure. How did you ensure quality while meeting the deadline?"
- **Probe for Action**: What corners were you tempted to cut? How did you maintain standards?
- **Probe for Result**: What was delivered? Any issues discovered later?

### Continuous Learning & Mentorship (4 mins)

**Question 9**: "Tell me about the most challenging technical concept you've had to learn recently. How did you approach mastering it?"
- **Probe for Action**: What resources did you use? Who did you learn from?
- **Probe for Result**: How do you know you've mastered it? Have you taught it to others?

### Innovative Spirit (4 mins)

**Question 10**: "Describe a time when you came up with a creative solution to a technical problem. What made it innovative?"
- **Probe for Situation**: What was the constraint or challenge?
- **Probe for Action**: What was your unique approach? Why hadn't others tried it?
- **Probe for Result**: What was the impact? Did others adopt your approach?

---

## Part 3: Pair Programming Assessment (45 mins)

**Transition**: "Now let's shift to some collaborative coding. I have a project set up that builds on the concepts from your take-home assignment, but focuses on production-ready patterns like resilience, testing, and security."

*[Interviewer introduces the pair programming task from `/pair_programming/` directory]*

**Technical Focus Areas** (assessed through pair programming):
- **Technical Excellence**: Resilience patterns implementation
- **Security & Compliance**: Secure secret management  
- **Integrity & Reliability**: Testing strategy and implementation
- **Observability & Guardrails**: Monitoring and health checks

---

## Part 4: Candidate Questions (5 mins)

**Interviewer**: "We have a few minutes left. What questions do you have for me about the role, the team, or Gefjon Growth?"

## Interviewer Notes & Scoring

### BEI Scoring Guidelines

For each core value, score: **STRONG** / **ADEQUATE** / **WEAK** / **MISSING**

**Customer-Centric Craftsmanship**:
- **Strong**: Shows deep empathy for users, validates assumptions, iterates based on feedback
- **Weak**: Makes assumptions without validation, focuses on technical elegance over user needs

**Ownership & Proactivity**:
- **Strong**: Goes beyond requirements, takes initiative on problems, follows through
- **Weak**: Does minimum required, waits for explicit direction, narrow scope of responsibility

**Data-Informed Iteration**:
- **Strong**: Regularly uses metrics to guide decisions, measures success, iterates based on data
- **Weak**: Makes decisions based on gut feeling, doesn't measure impact

**Integrity & Reliability**:
- **Strong**: Takes responsibility for issues, communicates transparently, prioritizes long-term quality
- **Weak**: Blames external factors, cuts corners under pressure, reactive rather than preventive

**Continuous Learning & Mentorship**:
- **Strong**: Actively seeks learning opportunities, shares knowledge with others, stays current
- **Weak**: Learning only when required, keeps knowledge to themselves

**Innovative Spirit**:
- **Strong**: Questions status quo, proposes creative solutions, willing to experiment
- **Weak**: Follows established patterns without questioning, risk-averse

### Key Red Flags to Watch For:
- Blaming others without taking responsibility
- No examples of going beyond minimum requirements  
- Difficulty providing specific examples with concrete outcomes
- No evidence of learning from failures or feedback
- Lack of consideration for end users or other developers

### Positive Signals:
- Concrete examples with measurable outcomes
- Shows learning and growth from experiences
- Demonstrates empathy for users and colleagues
- Takes ownership of both successes and failures
- Shows curiosity and willingness to experiment

## Post-Interview Synthesis

**Overall Assessment Framework**:
1. **BEI Results**: Which core values are demonstrated vs missing?
2. **Technical Results**: Can they implement production-ready patterns?
3. **Cultural Fit**: Do they align with our values and working style?
4. **Growth Potential**: Can they learn and develop the missing areas?

**Decision Criteria**:
- **Strong Hire**: Demonstrates most core values behaviorally + strong technical execution
- **Hire**: Shows core values with some gaps + adequate technical skills + high learning ability
- **No Hire**: Missing critical core values or unable to execute technically with guidance
