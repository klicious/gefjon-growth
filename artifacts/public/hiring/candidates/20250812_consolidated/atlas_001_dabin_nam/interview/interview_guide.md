- "What would you do differently if you faced a similar situation again?"

#### Problem-Solving & Learning Agility - VALIDATION QUESTION  
**Primary Question**: "You mentioned learning MQTT and Wireshark to unblock the drone simulator development, and later self-studying RabbitMQ for the UAM project. Describe a specific situation where you had to quickly learn a completely new technology to solve a critical problem. What was your learning approach and how did you apply it?"

**Evidence to Validate**: Self-directed learning, problem-solving methodology, knowledge application

**Follow-up Questions**:
- "How do you typically approach learning a new technology under pressure?"
- "What resources do you use and how do you validate your understanding?"
- "How do you balance learning depth vs. speed when solving urgent problems?"

#### Technical Excellence & Craftsmanship - VALIDATION QUESTION
**Primary Question**: "Tell me about the ndhub container migration project where you consolidated containers and migrated from Java to Node.js. What was your approach to ensuring the migration maintained system quality and performance?"

**Evidence to Validate**: Technical decision-making, quality focus, system optimization

**Follow-up Questions**:
- "How did you decide on the migration strategy and validate it was working?"
- "What metrics did you use to measure success?"
- "How did you ensure the new system met or exceeded the original performance?"

### Part 2: Probing Missing Values (25 minutes)

#### Mathematical/Algorithmic Thinking - DISCOVERY QUESTION
**Primary Question**: "Our platform involves quantitative trading algorithms and mathematical optimization. Tell me about a time when you had to solve a complex algorithmic or mathematical problem in your work. How did you approach it?"

**Looking For**: Analytical thinking, mathematical problem-solving approach, comfort with quantitative challenges

**Follow-up Questions**:
- "How do you typically break down complex mathematical or algorithmic problems?"
- "What's your experience with performance optimization that required mathematical analysis?"
- "How comfortable are you with statistical concepts or financial mathematics?"

#### Innovation & Continuous Improvement - DISCOVERY QUESTION
**Primary Question**: "We value innovative thinking and continuous improvement. Describe a time when you proposed or implemented an innovative solution or process improvement that went beyond the basic requirements."

**Looking For**: Creative problem-solving, initiative in improvement, innovation mindset

**Follow-up Questions**:
- "What inspired you to think of this innovative approach?"
- "How did you convince others to try your idea?"
- "What's an example of a technical trend or innovation you're excited about?"

#### AI/ML Learning Potential - DISCOVERY QUESTION
**Primary Question**: "Our platform is increasingly incorporating AI and machine learning capabilities. While you haven't worked directly with AI/ML, tell me about a time when you had to quickly adapt to a completely new technical paradigm or way of thinking about problems."

**Looking For**: Adaptability, learning approach for new paradigms, interest in AI/ML

**Follow-up Questions**:
- "How do you approach learning technologies that require a different way of thinking?"
- "What's your current understanding of AI/ML and how it might apply to software development?"
- "How would you approach learning about LLMs and agentic AI systems?"

## Technical Deep-Dive Section - 20 minutes

### System Design Challenge

**Assessment Focus**:
- System architecture thinking
- Real-time system design
- Scalability considerations
- Technology choices and trade-offs

### Database Optimization Scenario
**Question**: "You have a PostgreSQL database storing trading positions that's experiencing slow query performance during market hours. Walk me through your debugging and optimization approach."
