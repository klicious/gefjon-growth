# Interview Script: Phoenix (Hyungkyu Ahn)

## Introduction (5 minutes)

**Interviewer Opening**:
"Good morning, Hyungkyu! Thank you for taking the time to interview with us today. I'm [Name], [Title] here at Gefjon Growth, and I'm joined by [Name], [Title]. 

We're really excited to learn more about you today. I have to say, your background is exceptionally well-aligned with what we're building. Your experience with capital markets middleware at H2O System, combined with your crypto arbitrage system work, represents exactly the kind of financial systems expertise we need for our trading platform.

Let me start by telling you about what we do. At Gefjon Growth, our mission is to engineer cross-region, self-healing fintech platforms that move capital instantly for liquidity and strategically for future value, while guaranteeing systemic safety and investor trust. Our Platform Development Team builds and operates a fully-automated trading platform that trades digital assets profitably across 27 crypto instruments, with real-time risk management and portfolio tracking.

Today's interview will be about 2.5 hours total. We'll spend the first hour getting to know you better through behavioral questions, then dive deep into technical discussions, do a collaborative coding session focused on high-performance systems, and finish with system architecture design. Throughout, please feel free to ask questions - we want this to be a conversation.

Any questions before we get started?"

## Rapport Building & Personalization (3 minutes)

**Personalized Opening**:
"I was really impressed with your achievement of doubling throughput from 50k to 100k messages per second through the ZeroMQ migration at H2O System. That kind of measurable performance improvement is exactly what we need for our high-frequency trading systems. And your ongoing crypto arbitrage project shows you understand the real-time, low-latency requirements that are critical for our platform.

Your Investment Manager certification also caught my attention - it shows you're not just technically strong, but you understand the financial domain from a business perspective too.

Before we dive into the formal questions, I'm curious - what drew you from web development into the world of high-performance financial systems?"
