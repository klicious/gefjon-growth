# Screening Report: Choi Yeon-Cheol

## 1. Recommendation
`**Strong Match**`

## 2. Justification
Choi Yeon-Cheol is a compelling candidate who has successfully pivoted from a QA engineering role to backend development. His 2 years of QA experience provide a strong foundation in testing, quality, and system analysis, which is highly valuable for a developer. His recent, intensive bootcamp training and practical project work (especially the "Toketrip" and "Cleaning-service Website" projects) demonstrate direct, hands-on experience with the required tech stack, including Spring Boot, REST APIs, CI/CD with Docker and GitHub Actions, and performance optimization.

## 3. Detailed Analysis
- **Experience Level:** Meets the entry-level criteria. His 2 years of QA experience are a bonus, not a disqualifier.
- **Skill Match:**
    - **Strengths:** Strong overlap with core skills, including Java/Spring, REST API, MySQL, Git, and CI/CD (Jenkins, Docker, GitHub Actions). His experience with reactive programming (WebFlux) is a plus.
    - **Weaknesses:** Limited direct experience with data pipelines and portfolio analytics, but his background suggests he can learn quickly.
- **Project Assessment:** The "Toketrip" project is a standout, showing an ability to tackle performance issues and use modern reactive frameworks. The "Cleaning-service Website" project demonstrates practical CI/CD implementation.
- **Value Alignment:** Aligns well with "Quality," "Perseverance," and "Collaboration." His QA background naturally orients him towards reliability and technical excellence.

## 4. Key Discussion Points for Interview
- Explore the "Toketrip" project in detail: what caused the latency, and how did he arrive at his solution?
- Discuss how his QA experience influences his approach to writing code and designing systems.
- Assess his understanding of data structures and algorithms relevant to quantitative systems.
- Inquire about his interest in the financial domain.

## 5. Next Steps
- **Action:** Strongly recommend for a technical interview. He is a high-potential candidate for the role.
