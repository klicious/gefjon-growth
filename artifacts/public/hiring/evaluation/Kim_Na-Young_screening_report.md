# Screening Report: Kim Na-Young

## 1. Recommendation
**Moderate Match**

## 2. Justification
Kim Na-Young is a promising computer science undergraduate with a clear interest in backend development and data science. Her internship, project work, and active participation in tech clubs demonstrate a strong drive and a solid foundational knowledge. However, her professional experience is very limited, and she lacks demonstrated experience in several core skills required by the job description, such as API design, data pipelines, and CI/CD.

## 3. Detailed Analysis
- **Experience Level:** Meets the entry-level criteria (1-month internship, student).
- **Skill Match:**
    - **Strengths:** Python, Java/Spring, basic AWS knowledge.
    - **Weaknesses:** Lacks explicit experience in API design, data pipelines, low-latency systems, testing, and CI/CD.
- **Project Assessment:** Projects are relevant and show initiative (e.g., "Camping-style Recommendation Service"). They demonstrate an ability to build a full-stack application but lack the depth and scale of a professional environment.
- **Value Alignment:** Strong alignment with "Continuous Learning" and "Initiative."

## 4. Key Discussion Points for Interview
- Probe deeper into her understanding of backend concepts like REST API design principles.
- Discuss her approach to testing and code quality in her projects.
- Ask about her motivation for applying to a role focused on low-latency trading systems and portfolio analytics.
- Evaluate her problem-solving approach using a hypothetical scenario.

## 5. Next Steps
- **Action:** Recommend for a first-round technical interview to assess fundamental knowledge and growth potential.
