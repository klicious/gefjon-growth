- **Industry Exposure**: Research lab experience (COMPAS Lab) with OpenStack private cloud migration
- **Full-Stack Capability**: End-to-end development from frontend (React) to infrastructure (AWS/Terraform)

**Project Complexity Indicators:**
- Code Ground: Real-time coding battle platform with Glicko-style matching, autoscaling, and observability
- Imjangdan: Enterprise-grade real-estate survey app with HA/DR design on AWS + VMware ESXi
- Infrastructure Labs: Ansible/Terraform automation with educational content creation

**Leadership Evidence**: Acted as team lead enabling peers through role distribution and mentoring

### Company Culture Fit (9.0/10.0) - Weight: 20%

**Strong alignment with core engineering values**

**Value Alignment Evidence:**
- **Ownership**: Led backend and HA/DR infrastructure coordination, drove queue-metric autoscaling strategy
- **Communication**: Presented hands-on 'Terraform & Ansible IaC' seminars and authored lab materials
- **Problem-Solving**: Systematic approach to replacing memory-based policies with queue metrics, designing resilient architectures
- **Learning & Growth**: Built diverse side projects (banking, fashion recommendation, defense wiki) to broaden domain knowledge
- **Leadership & Mentoring**: Team lead experience with peer enablement and role distribution
- **Operational Excellence**: Introduced HA/DR and observability practices in project infrastructure

**Collaboration Indicators**: Multi-team university and hackathon projects, cross-functional FE/BE/Infra work

**Communication Style**: Professional technical presentation and documentation creation

### Career Trajectory (9.5/10.0) - Weight: 15%

**Excellent growth trajectory with clear technical progression**

**Evidence:**
- **Rapid Skill Development**: From academic projects to production systems with modern DevOps practices
- **Certification Achievement**: AWS certifications demonstrate commitment to professional development
- **Technical Leadership**: Progression from contributor to team lead and technical presenter
- **Goal Alignment**: Strong fit with entry-level engineer role requiring AWS, Python, and infrastructure skills
- **Stability Indicators**: Consistent project completion and current employment stability

**Learning Agility**: Demonstrated through diverse technology adoption (React, FastAPI, Terraform, Ansible, AWS)

**Growth Potential**: Strong foundation for scaling to senior engineer role with mentorship

## Recommendation Rationale

**Strong Hire recommendation based on:**

1. **Technical Excellence**: Exceptional AWS expertise with certifications and hands-on experience exceeds entry-level requirements
2. **Modern Stack Alignment**: FastAPI, React, AWS, CI/CD experience directly matches job requirements

4. **Leadership Potential**: Demonstrated team leadership and knowledge sharing through seminars
5. **Cultural Fit**: Strong evidence of ownership, problem-solving, and operational excellence values

**Risk Mitigation**: Limited production experience offset by strong project portfolio and rapid learning demonstrated

## Next Steps

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Take-Home Assignment**: FastAPI-based system design with AWS deployment requirements
2. **Technical Interview Focus**: System architecture, scalability patterns, AWS best practices
3. **Behavioral Interview**: Leadership experience, problem-solving approach, team collaboration

**Interview Preparation:**
- Prepare questions about Code Ground architecture and scaling decisions
- Explore HA/DR design thinking and trade-off analysis
- Discuss transition from GitHub Actions to GitLab CI/CD

**Onboarding Considerations:**
- Leverage AWS expertise for immediate contribution
- Pair with senior engineer for financial domain knowledge transfer
- Consider for infrastructure/DevOps project leadership opportunities
