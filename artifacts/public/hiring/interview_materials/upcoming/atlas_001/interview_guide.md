# Interview Guide: atlas_001 (PII masked)

## General Guidance for Interviewers
Atlas presents strong fundamentals and ownership signals from a QA→Backend pivot, with meaningful exposure to performance optimization and CI/CD. Calibrate to entry-level. Focus on validating testing depth, quantitative reasoning, and readiness for low-latency/analytics contexts. Use the STAR method for behavioral, insist on specific evidence, and avoid bias by scoring only against criteria.

## Session Plans

### 1) Behavioral (BEI) — 20–25 min
- Validate evidence:
  - Technical Excellence & Scalable Elegance: “Walk us through a time you improved service performance. What were the constraints, and how did your design scale?”
    - Follow-ups: “How did you measure p95/latency?” “What trade-offs did you reject and why?”
  - Ownership & Proactivity: “Tell us about a time you implemented CI/CD or tooling without being asked. What problem did this solve?”
    - Follow-ups: “What risks did you consider?” “What outcomes did you track?”
- Probe missing/unclear evidence:
  - Security & Compliance First: “Describe a time you handled secrets or sensitive data. How did you ensure secure handling across environments?”
    - Follow-ups: “What would you change in hindsight?”
  - Collaboration & Knowledge-Sharing: “Share an example of mentoring or being mentored during your QA→backend transition.”
    - Follow-ups: “How did you incorporate feedback?”

### 2) Pair-Programming — 35–45 min
- Problem: Intermediate I-3 Mini Matching Engine (from problem bank)
- Rationale: Tests data structures, event handling, and correctness under constraints—relevant to trading/low-latency systems.
- Success signals: Clean invariants, correct crossing logic, thought process, incremental tests.

### 3) System Design — 30–35 min
- Prompt (tailored): “Design a minimal portfolio-analytics microservice that computes moving-average crossovers on instrument candles and publishes signals via a REST endpoint. Discuss data model, ingestion cadence, stateless vs. stateful components, and how you’d test for correctness and latency.”
- Evaluation: Coherent API, simple scalable pipeline, correctness checks, logging/metrics hooks, clear trade-offs.

### 4) Technical Deep-Dive — 20–25 min
Primary questions (with follow-ups):
1. Toketrip performance remediation: “Identify the root cause you observed and the steps you took. Why WebFlux? What metrics improved?”
   - Follow-up: “How would you reproduce and guard against regressions?”
2. Testing philosophy from QA→Dev: “How do you structure unit vs. integration tests? What constitutes a good test in your view?”
   - Follow-up: “Example of flaky test stabilization.”
3. Data structures/algorithms for matching/analytics: “When would you prefer heap vs. tree for order book ops?”
   - Follow-up: “Complexity trade-offs under bursty load.”
4. Domain interest (finance): “What aspects of portfolio analytics interest you and why?”
   - Follow-up: “How would you learn quickly in week 1?”
5. CI/CD details: “Describe a GitHub Actions workflow you’d set up for this service.”
   - Follow-up: “What gates and artifacts would you enforce?”

### 5) Scoring Reminders
- Use the standardized rubric and write evidence-based notes referencing specific statements or artifacts.
- Note any bias checks and red/green flags explicitly.
