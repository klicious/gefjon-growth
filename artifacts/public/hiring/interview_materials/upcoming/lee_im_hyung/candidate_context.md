# Candidate Context: Lee Im-Hyung

## 1. Executive Summary
Lee Im-Hyung is an exceptionally promising entry-level engineer with a specialized, modern skill set in LLM and RAG development. Despite having no professional work experience, he was the top-prize winner at a competitive AI bootcamp and graduated with a high GPA. His projects, particularly an allergy-safe recipe chatbot using a RAG pipeline, demonstrate a deep understanding of current AI technologies and a drive for technical excellence. He is a high-potential candidate whose skills are directly aligned with our company's focus on applied AI.

## 2. Key Information
- **Role Applying For:** Entry-Level Backend Engineer
- **Total Experience:** 0 years (bootcamp and academic projects)
- **Education:** B.S. Intelligent Mechanical Engineering (AI-Robotics), Sejong University
- **Key Skills:** Python, LangChain, RAG, FAISS, OpenAI API, Flask, Pandas, NumPy

## 3. Experience & Project Highlights

### **Project: Allergy-safe Recipe Chatbot**
- **Description:** Built a chatbot using a RAG pipeline with LangChain and FAISS to provide safe recipes, winning the top prize at his bootcamp.
- **Relevance:** This is his flagship project. It showcases cutting-edge skills in LLM, RAG, and vector databases, which are highly relevant to our work. It also demonstrates his ability to deliver award-winning, high-quality projects.

### **Project: AI Golf Assistant**
- **Description:** Developed a Flask-based application using OpenCV to assist novice golfers.
- **Relevance:** Shows his ability to build a complete web application from scratch and his experience with computer vision, a complementary skill to our AI focus.

### **Project: Seoul Restaurant-district Analysis**
- **Description:** Used Python, Pandas, and Tableau to analyze and visualize restaurant data.
- **Relevance:** Demonstrates strong foundational skills in data analysis and manipulation, which are essential for any data-driven engineering role.

## 4. Core Value Alignment

- **Technical Excellence:**
  - **Evidence:** Proactively built a RAG pipeline to reduce hallucinations for his allergy-safe recipe chatbot, a sophisticated approach for an entry-level candidate.
- **Impact:**
  - **Evidence:** His projects are targeted at helping vulnerable or specific user groups (allergy patients, novice golfers), showing a desire to build impactful products.
- **Leadership:**
  - **Evidence:** Served as the team lead for the AI Golf Assistant project, where he was responsible for code merges and schedule management.

## 5. Points to Clarify (Red Flags)
- **No Professional Experience:** He has never worked in a professional software development environment. We need to assess his understanding of production systems, collaboration tools (beyond academic use), and software development lifecycles.
- **Scalability and Production Readiness:** His projects are prototypes. We must probe his understanding of what it takes to make a system like his recipe chatbot scalable, reliable, and secure for thousands of users.
