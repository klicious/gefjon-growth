# Interview Script: Lee Im-Hyung

---

### **1. Introduction (5 mins)**

**Interviewer:** "Hi Lee Im-Hyung, welcome! My name is [Interviewer Name], and I'm a [Your Role] here. Also joining us is [Second Interviewer Name and Role]. Thank you for making the time to speak with us today."

"To start, I'd like to give you a brief overview of our mission. At our core, we are dedicated to [Company Mission]. Our team, the Platform Development Team, is responsible for building the intelligent, high-performance systems that our business relies on. We work on complex challenges in areas like real-time data, low-latency trading, and, importantly, applied AI, which is why we were so interested in your profile."

"We have about an hour scheduled for our conversation. We'll begin with some questions about your projects and background, then get into some more specific technical topics. We will definitely save time at the end for any questions you might have for us. Does that sound good?"

### **2. Rapport Building & Personalization (2-3 mins)**

**Interviewer:** "Great. Before we get started, I wanted to say that your final project at the bootcamp, the allergy-safe recipe chatbot, was very impressive. Winning the top prize is a significant achievement, and building a full RAG pipeline is not a trivial task. We're excited to hear more about it."

---

### **3. Behavioral Interview (BEI) Section (20-25 mins)**

**Interviewer:** "I'd like to understand your experiences a bit better. I'm going to ask a few behavioral questions. It would be very helpful if you could frame your answers using the STAR method—that is, describing the Situation, the Task you were facing, the Action you took, and the final Result."

*   **(Question 1):** "Let's start with that award-winning recipe chatbot. Could you tell me about the decision to build a RAG pipeline? What specific problems, like hallucinations or outdated information, were you seeing with the base model, and how did your RAG implementation directly address those issues?"
    *   *(Probe for: His diagnostic process, the trade-offs of RAG, how he evaluated the improvement.)*

*   **(Question 2):** "You were the team lead for the AI Golf Assistant project. Can you describe a time you had a disagreement with a team member about a technical approach or a feature? How did you facilitate a resolution, and what was the outcome?"
    *   *(Probe for: His communication style, how he handles conflict, his ability to lead and compromise.)*

*   **(Question 3):** "Many of your projects are focused on helping specific user groups, like allergy patients or novice golfers. What does 'building for impact' mean to you personally, and how would you apply that principle here, where our primary users are expert financial traders?"
    *   *(Probe for: His ability to empathize with different user types, his thoughts on what 'impact' means in a B2B or expert context.)*

### **4. Technical Deep-Dive Section (15-20 mins)**

**Interviewer:** "Thanks for sharing that. Now, let's zoom in on some of the technical details."

*   **(Question 1):** "Let's do a thought experiment with your recipe chatbot. Imagine it becomes incredibly popular, with 100,000 users asking questions concurrently. What parts of your current architecture, from the frontend to the vector database, would break first? How would you redesign it for that kind of scale?"
*   **(Question 2):** "In your Flask applications, how do you typically manage application configuration—things like API keys, database URIs, and other settings? What are the security and maintenance trade-offs between the different approaches you've considered?"
*   **(Question 3):** "When you were building the backend for the AI Golf Assistant, how did you structure your data models? If the frontend team came to you today and asked for a new feature—an API endpoint to show a user's performance improvement over time—how would you design that endpoint and the underlying query?"

### **5. Candidate Q&A (5-10 mins)**

**Interviewer:** "Okay, that's all from my side. Now, I'd like to hand it over to you. What can we answer for you? What questions do you have about the role, the team, our tech stack, or the company culture?"

---

### **6. Closing (2-3 mins)**

**Interviewer:** "Thank you, Im-Hyung, for the insightful questions and for the great conversation today. We really enjoyed learning more about your projects. Our recruiting team will be in touch with you about the next steps in our process within the next [Timeframe, e.g., 'few days']. Have a great rest of your day!"
