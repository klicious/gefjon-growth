# Candidate Context: nova_002 (PII masked)

## 1. Executive Summary
Nova is an entry-level backend candidate with strong academic grounding (CS undergraduate) and early exposure to Python and Java/Spring. Signals include initiative via relevant projects and tech clubs, plus basic AWS familiarity. Professional experience is limited; gaps include REST API design depth, pipelines, low‑latency systems, testing, and CI/CD. Overall fit: Moderate Match with high growth potential; recommended to proceed to technical loop to validate fundamentals and learning velocity.

## 2. Key Information
- Applying for: Entry-Level Backend Engineer
- Experience: Student + ~1 month internship
- Skills: Python, Java/Spring, basic AWS
- Noted Gaps: API design depth, data pipelines, low-latency systems, testing, CI/CD

## 3. Experience & Project Highlights
- “Camping-style Recommendation Service” (full-stack project)
  - Relevance: Demonstrates initiative and ability to ship end-to-end; use to probe API design choices and testing approach.
- Tech Clubs & Hackathons
  - Relevance: Collaboration and learning mindset; probe for ownership examples and lessons learned.

## 4. Core Value Alignment (Evidence)
- Continuous Learning & Mentorship: Active participation in clubs/projects; pursuing backend skills.
- Ownership & Proactivity: Built projects beyond coursework; self-directed learning.
