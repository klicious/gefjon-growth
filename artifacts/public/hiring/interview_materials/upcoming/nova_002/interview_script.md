## Opening & BEI Introduction (10 minutes)

### Welcome & Context Setting
"Good [morning/afternoon], Donghyun. Thank you for taking the time to meet with us today. I'm [Name] and I'll be conducting your interview for the Backend Engineer position at Gefjon Growth. 

Before we begin, I'd like to give you a brief overview of how today's interview will be structured. We'll spend about 90 minutes together, with the majority focused on understanding your past experiences through specific behavioral examples, followed by some technical discussion.

Do you have any questions about the structure before we begin?"

### BEI Methodology Explanation
"Today, I'll be using what we call Behavioral Event Interviewing, or BEI. The premise is simple: the best predictor of future performance is past behavior in similar situations. So I'll be asking you to share specific examples from your experience.

When I ask these questions, I'm looking for complete stories using what we call the STAR method:
- **Situation**: What was the context or background?
- **Task**: What was your specific responsibility or challenge?
- **Action**: What specific actions did YOU take?
- **Results**: What was the outcome and what did you learn?

I may ask follow-up questions to get more details about specific parts of your examples. The key is to focus on specific situations rather than general approaches. Does this make sense?"

### Transition to Questions
"Great. Let's begin with some questions about how you approach your work and the experiences that have shaped your professional development."
