### **3. Behavioral Interview (BEI) Section (20-25 mins)**

**Interviewer:** "I'd love to learn more about your hands-on experience. I'm going to ask a few behavioral questions. If you could answer them using the STAR method—that is, describing the Situation, the Task you faced, the Action you took, and the final Result—that would be very helpful."

*   **(Question 1):** "Let's start with the 'Chung-an Downtown Revitalization App'. Your resume mentions you led the backend API and DB schema. Could you walk me through that process? What was the most challenging technical decision you had to make, and what was the outcome?"
    *   *(Probe for: Specifics on the schema, API design choices, how he collaborated with the team, what made the decision challenging.)*

*   **(Question 2):** "Now, let's talk about that award-winning 'Heart & Lung Sound AI Challenge'. Tell me about the moment you decided to use an SRGAN model. What was the core problem you were trying to solve, and why was that the right approach compared to others you might have considered?"
    *   *(Probe for: His research process, how he validated the approach, the trade-offs he considered.)*

*   **(Question 3):** "It's great that you handled the full stack for the 'Pet-Care AI Web-platform'. Could you describe a situation where a decision you made on the backend had a significant impact on the frontend, and how you managed that trade-off?"

*   **(Question 1):** "In your internship at ITEL, you worked on data-pipeline automation for a patent-fee manager. What specific AWS services did you use to build that pipeline? Can you sketch out the data flow from start to finish and explain how you ensured its reliability?"
*   **(Question 2):** "In your Django projects, have you ever needed to handle long-running or asynchronous tasks? If so, how did you implement that? What are your thoughts on the pros and cons of Django's ORM?"
