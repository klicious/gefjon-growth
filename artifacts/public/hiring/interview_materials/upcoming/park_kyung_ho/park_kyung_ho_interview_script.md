## 1. Introduction (5 mins)

**Interviewer:** "Hi Kyung Ho, welcome. Thanks for joining us today. My name is [Interviewer Name], and I'm a [Your Role] on the Platform Development Team here at Gefjon Growth. Also with us is [Interviewer 2 Name], who is a [Their Role].

To give you a bit of context, our mission at Gefjon Growth is to engineer self-healing fintech platforms that move capital instantly and strategically, all while guaranteeing systemic safety and investor trust. Our team, the Platform Development Team, is at the heart of that mission. We're building a fully-automated, autonomous fintech platform that can trade digital assets profitably and eventually run without direct human intervention.

Today, we're looking forward to a conversation to learn more about your experience and how it might align with our team. We'll start with some questions about your background and projects, then dive into a technical discussion. We'll be sure to leave plenty of time at the end for any questions you might have for us. Sound good?"

## 2. Rapport Building & Personalization (2-3 mins)

**Interviewer:** "Great. Before we dive in, I have to say I was really impressed with your contribution to the Spring AI library. It's not often we see candidates who not only identify a breaking change in a major open-source project but also take the initiative to document it, submit a fix, and get it merged. That kind of ownership is exactly what we value here."

## 3. Behavioral Interview (BEI) Section (20-25 mins)

**Interviewer:** "I'd like to start by asking a few behavioral questions to understand how you've approached different situations in the past. We use the STAR method here, so if you could frame your answers in terms of the Situation, your Task, the Action you took, and the Result, that would be very helpful.

1.  **Based on your `spring-ai` contribution:** Tell me about a time you had to influence a team or individual that you didn't have any formal authority over. How did you convince them to adopt your recommendation? What was the outcome?
    *   *(Reminder: Probe for the specifics of the situation, the actions he took to communicate the issue, and the result of his contribution.)*

2.  **Based on your DevOps experience:** Describe a situation where you had to make a significant technical decision with incomplete information. How did you approach the problem, and what was the result?
    *   *(Reminder: Look for evidence of a structured thought process, risk assessment, and a clear rationale for his decision.)*

3.  Tell me about a time you had a disagreement with a colleague about a technical approach. How did you handle it, and what was the outcome?
    *   *(Reminder: Assess his ability to handle conflict constructively and focus on a positive outcome for the team.)*

4.  **Probing for Integrity & Observability:** Tell me about a time you made a significant technical mistake that impacted users or the system. How did you handle the situation, what was the immediate aftermath, and what did you learn from it?
    *   *(Reminder: This is a crucial question. Listen for a blameless, proactive response that focuses on learning and prevention.)*

## 4. Technical Deep-Dive Section (15-20 mins)

**Interviewer:** "Thanks for sharing those insights. Now, I'd like to transition to a more technical discussion and dive into a couple of your projects.

1.  **On the `Warehouse Reservation` project:** You used pessimistic locking to handle concurrency. What other approaches did you consider, and why did you choose pessimistic locking? What are the trade-offs of this approach?

2.  **On testing:** Can you walk me through your testing strategy for the `why_price` project? What types of tests did you write, and how did you ensure the quality of your code? What is your philosophy on unit testing, and what do you think is a reasonable level of test coverage?"

## 5. Candidate Q&A (5-10 mins)
