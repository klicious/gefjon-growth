# Prologue

- **Tactics for Winning Wars**
    - The organizational operation style of American tech companies
    - A process is an unseen but quietly indispensable force that drives the formation of successful organizational habits and sustains them over time
    - **Strategy vs. Tactics:**
        - Strategy = the plan to win a war; Tactics = the method to execute that plan
        - In short, strategy addresses the “What,” whereas tactics address the “How”
    - **Elements Necessary for Strengthening Organizational Cohesion:**
        - Enhancing the organization’s ability to execute
        - Building a robust internal culture that fosters unity
        - Establishing a fair and reliable evaluation system
    - **Tactics in Practice: Standard Operating Process (SOP)**
        - A product planning SOP that creates innovative products and services
        - An agile work management SOP that boosts organizational execution
        - A culture-building SOP that forges a strong, customer-first organization
- A process is a remarkably powerful tool and tactic that ensures the sustained execution of actions.

# Chapter 1. Designing Success Through Process

- **The Visionary Steve Jobs and the Quiet Operator Tim Cook**
- **Great Operators Transform Corporate DNA**
    - One of Tim Cook’s greatest achievements was revolutionizing Apple’s supply chain management process.
    - “Cook not only introduced processes that changed how Apple tackles problems, but also processes that have reshaped our work methods and corporate culture.”
    - A capable operator runs the company successfully through processes and transforms the corporate DNA and culture.
    - A robust operational process is the foundation of an irreplaceable company.
- **The Balance of Vision and Process**
    - Successful companies emerge when visionaries and operators coexist, synergizing together.
- **The Power of Systematic Operations in a Rapidly Changing Era**
    - A common thread among the historical rise and fall of companies is their inability to cross the market’s inflection point when environmental changes occur.
    - To survive in an ever-changing market, companies naturally embed agile and flexible operational methods.
    - The concept of “scalability” is one of the core values of any enterprise.
        - Systems overly dependent on individuals lack scalability.
    - Traditional operating styles of native companies are grossly insufficient in navigating the VUCA (Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity) era.
- **The Twin Pillars Sustaining an Operational System: Customer-Centricity and Strengthened Organizational Capacity**
    - Regardless of how the world changes, if a company consistently delivers the “value customers desire,” it will not be forsaken by its clientele.
    - There must be a clear answer as to “what problem the product solves.”
    - Being customer-centric is not merely about satisfying customer demands or achieving high customer satisfaction; it is about devising a perfect solution even before the customer realizes there is a problem.
    - Such products and services make a “vertical leap” by creating entirely new markets from nothing.
    - In an era of rapid technological advancement, companies that focus solely on what the customer says they want risk falling behind.
    - The essence of a strong organizational culture is to bolster the organization’s ability to respond swiftly amid rapid changes.
        - Only when every team member takes ownership and moves in unison toward a common goal can an organization achieve rapid execution and unity.
        - The role of the enterprise is to:
            - Create work systems and environments that enable fast execution
            - Develop a culture and evaluation-reward system that motivates every team member to demonstrate ownership
- **The Power of Process in Establishing a “Winning Habit” in Corporations**
    - “Corporate management is only possible in a systematic operational mechanism designed to achieve its goals, not merely by good intentions.” – Jeff Bezos
    - For mechanism-driven management, process is paramount.
    - Processes lend consistency, and repetitive behavioral patterns form habits.
    - **Designing Processes for Customer-Centricity and Strengthened Organizational Capacity:**
        - A product planning SOP that creates innovative products and services
            - Anchored in customer-centric product planning
        - An agile work management SOP that builds a nimble organization
            - Processes for agile work management
            - Standardized template methods
            - Operating weekly meetings using such templates
        - An SOP that forges an enterprising and robust organizational culture
            - Hiring practices that select only proactive, enterprising individuals
            - The customer-first principle
                - By infusing every process with a clear focus on customer centricity, ownership and organizational cohesion are heightened
            - Behavioral Event Interviews (BEI)
    - **Expected Benefits from Process Implementation:**
        - The organization’s core DNA shifts toward customer-centricity
        - An increase in the pace of work
        - The emergence of formidable organizational capacity underpinned by a solid culture
        - Change becomes measurable
- **From Processes for the Few to Processes for Everyone**
    - The “Single Threaded Leader” model (Amazon’s organizational structure where one leader is solely tasked with a single goal) exemplifies this idea.
    - The primary purpose of process-driven management is to fundamentally reinvent organizations to yield optimal performance.
    - No risk is greater than depending on a single individual’s capability to produce results.
    - The greatest risk in implementing process-driven management does not lie in the employees or even in the alignment between processes and the company, but in the senior executives:
        - The greatest risk is when the ultimate decision-maker lacks the will to sustain the process or tends to bypass the process arbitrarily.
    - Determined commitment from top management is needed for continuity.
    - Teams may initially pilot the processes.
    - Because results are not achieved by executing a single process in isolation, the practical implementation can be challenging.
- **Processes Work in Every Company**
    - “There are no employees who work autonomously without guidance.”
    - A methodical, step-by-step delineation of work and clear instructions for employees universally works across companies—and employees will adapt accordingly.
    - Process is a means to achieve the desired outcomes.
    - It must be adjusted to fit the specific environments and characteristics of the organization.

# Chapter 2. SOP for Creating Innovative Products

- **Innovative products are born from innovative processes.**
    - In *Zero to One*, Peter Thiel underscores the importance of creative innovation: only companies that pioneer new markets and secure a monopoly in them can achieve sustainable growth.
    - **Prerequisites for Innovative Product Planning:**
        - The process must cover essential stages before a product’s launch:
            - **Product Ideation Stage:** Generating product ideas and exploring avenues for commercialization
            - A stage to assess both the profitability and business viability of the product before making the final go/no-go decision
        - A systematic process that rigorously analyzes the feasibility of product launch from multiple perspectives enhances a company’s product management capabilities.
            - Although over 30,000 new consumer products are launched each year, 95% fail.
    - At the core of innovative products is customer centricity.
        - Emphasis is placed on building systematic processes that institutionalize and reinforce a company’s product planning capabilities.
        - A prominent framework here is the “customer centricity” framework.
        - It is crucial to distinguish between “customer-focused” and “customer-centric”:
            - **Customer Focused:** Providing what customers say they want
            - **Customer Centric:** Concentrating on what customers desperately need
        - Providing what customers truly need makes them dependent, eventually transforming them into “loyal customers.”
        - **Ideation Framework for Customer-Centric Product Planning:**
- **Product Ideation Framework 1**
    - The customer’s problem is defined as the discrepancy between the most ideal customer experience and the current state.
    - It is crucial to clearly recognize and define the problem.
    - The difference between a merchant’s mindset and an entrepreneurial mindset:
        - **Merchant:** Focuses on immediately selling products and services to generate short-term profit
        - **Entrepreneur:** Concentrates on solving the customer’s problem to maximize future enterprise value
    - First, solve the problem, then determine the revenue model.
        - Once the problem is solved, focus on how to maximize the revenue the product can generate.
            - Diversify customer definitions
                - From starting with simple services like money transfers (e.g., Toss) to a range of products
            - Consider externalizing core functionalities of the product as a service to other companies (Product Externalization)
                - Example: AWS cloud services
    - Within a customer-centric mindset, product planning begins by having the company itself become its most discerning customer and meticulously defining the gap between the ideal and reality in terms of money, time, and convenience.
- **Product Ideation Framework 2 – Focusing on “Complete Problem Resolution”**
    - Distinguish between “scaling down a problem” versus “eliminating the problem.”
        - Find the root cause and “destroy” the problem altogether.
    - Prioritize by starting with problem destruction and then minimizing the magnitude of the problem.
    - Imagine assigning a value of zero to the problem and then envision the customer experience when the problem is eradicated.
    - **Methodology:**
- **Product Ideation Framework 3 – The Future-Back Approach**
    - Start with the ideal customer experience and work backwards to develop the product.
    - This approach prevents inadvertent harm to the customer experience or the error of designing products based solely on one’s own desires, mistaking oneself for the customer.
    - It helps circumvent various complexities and issues that arise during product development, ensuring that the original design intent is maintained without compromise.
    - **Guidelines:**
    - **Comparison Example: Traditional Product Planning vs. Future-Back Planning (Self-Checkout Machines):**
        
        
        |  | Traditional Product Planning | Future-Back Planning |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        | **Starting Point** | A fixed idea about the product | The customer experience |
        | **Planning Approach** | 1. Because there are long queues, develop a self-checkout machine. 2. Figure out the detailed design and functions of the machine. | 1. Because there are long queues, create an experience where customers can check out without queuing.2. Determine how to enable payment without a physical queue. |
        | **Outcome** | The most convenient self-checkout machine | An unattended automated payment system |
- **An Idea is Only the Beginning: Evaluating Business Feasibility**
    - The process is designed to meticulously examine product-market fit and the viability of a business plan, thereby objectively assessing the potential for success once a product hits the market.
    - **Product-Market Fit:**
        - A product that addresses an urgent customer need
        - Not merely about demand but one that is based on a genuine “need”
        
        > “The only way to achieve exponential organic growth is through word of mouth. And the only way to gain word of mouth is by truly delighting customers.” – Andy Rachleff
        > 
    - **Feasibility Verification via the PR/FAQ Process:**
        - Known as Amazon’s “Working Backwards” approach
        - Before launching a product, a hypothetical press release (PR) and a list of frequently asked questions (FAQ) are drafted from the customer’s perspective.
        - True customer-centric product planning can only take place when the customer-centric mindset framework is in use.
        - Only a small fraction of products pass the final release approval via Amazon’s PR/FAQ process—it is an intentionally rigorous design.
- **A Practical PR/FAQ Template for Immediate Use**
    - **Unending Inquiry for Validation: External FAQs**
        - Questions that customers might ask, probing the product’s reliability and effectiveness:
        - Also, questions from actual product users:
    - **Internal FAQs – Questions from the Company’s Perspective**
        - These clarify the business objectives, resource needs, potential risks that could impede achieving the goals, and strategies to mitigate those risks.
- **The Importance of Writing to Cultivate Logical Thinking**
    - Using complete sentences in an essay-like format is an exceptionally clear mode of business communication that also enhances the quality of thought.
    - Drafting a PR/FAQ document is not a one-off internal presentation but rather a process of collecting feedback and iterating the document repeatedly.
    - Ironically, the greatest challenge in adopting the PR/FAQ process is writing itself.
    - Employees’ writing skills can be significantly improved through continual training and repeated practice.
    - Drafting a PR/FAQ requires an enormous amount of documentation work:
        - It serves as a checkpoint to ensure that the company is building the right products and services.
        - It prevents further waste of resources.
- **Applying the PR/FAQ Process for Product Launch – Part 1: A Company Language Protocol for Accurate Communication**
    - Unlike everyday language, execution-focused communication requires:
        - Specificity in language
        - Objectivity
        - Active voice
    - Similarities to programming languages emerge—each word in the PR/FAQ must carry a precise meaning.
    - Reports based on essay-style writing not only eliminate ambiguity but also reinforce employees’ critical thinking, thereby elevating work quality.
    - This process compels employees to continuously question the purpose, rationale, and success of their work.
- **The PR/FAQ Process is Especially Vital for Startups**
    - Before delving into product development, startups must rigorously examine their product-market fit and the business plan’s viability.
    - Launching a product without addressing potential gaps—even if it is market-fit—can lead to failure.
    - Rather than rushing into MVP creation and rapid execution, companies must thoroughly analyze and objectively evaluate whether the proposed product is indeed the right one.
    - Lean startups have inherent limitations when validating the product-market fit of truly groundbreaking, innovative products.
        
        > “Designing a product based on focus groups is truly challenging because most people don’t really know what they want until they see it.” – Steve Jobs
        > 
    - **From Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to Minimum Lovable Product (MLP):**
        - MLP defines the minimum criteria necessary for a product to be loved by the customer, acknowledging that truly innovative ideas often face resistance before widespread acceptance.
- **Applying the PR/FAQ Process for Product Launch – Part 2**
    - Secure undeniable evidence that resonates with everyone.
    - When introducing the FAQ process for the first time, it must be accompanied by education on accurate communication protocols.
    - Begin with comprehensive training, offer feedback over time, present examples of clear answers, and educate employees on precise language.
    - Given the strong connection between language and thought, accurate, objective internal communication enables more critical, action-oriented thinking.
    - The ultimate aim of the process is to arrive at the right product launch decision through critical and objective thinking.
    - It is essential for the company to develop a standard question template that must be answered when making product launch decisions.
    - This document can be collaboratively maintained (using tools like Notion or Google Docs) and reviewed collectively.
    - **Review Sessions:**
        - Allocate 20 minutes for participants to read through and note any ambiguities or logical inconsistencies, directly annotating the document.
    - Typically, the finalized PR/FAQ document undergoes five to six rounds of review, incorporating feedback and iterative revisions.
    - In the initial phase of process adoption, managers must actively coach and educate employees to adapt to the new process and communication style.
    - Once the final PR/FAQ is completed, a review session is held with senior executives or those with product launch authority:
        - For instance, a 20-minute reading followed by 40 minutes of discussion determines the final go/no-go decision.
    - The process of creating innovative products in innovative companies is less akin to a creative art and more comparable to logical, systematic science.
    - When developing a product, creating the “right product” is far more important than merely executing quickly.

# Chapter 3. SOP for Building an Agile Organization

**Operational Agility**

- The speed at which an organization executes directly impacts its productivity and profitability.
- To boost operational execution, leaders must be deeply involved in the organization’s work and attuned to the voices of frontline employees.
- **Characteristics of Organizations with Slow Execution:**
    - Unclear work plans
    - Inefficient collaboration
        - In a true collaborative environment, collaboration is not merely a request for help—it is a structured division of labor among many people working together under a defined plan.
    - A laissez-faire attitude that masks problems
        - If a leader is lax in ensuring execution, the employees will mirror that indifference.
- Such issues are addressed systematically by an agile work management process using a consistent template:
    - This process standardizes how all team members plan their work, collaborate with colleagues, and resolve work-related challenges, enabling the organization to move swiftly and dissolve work bottlenecks quickly.
- **Processes That Accelerate Execution:**
    - Focus on managing actions rather than just reporting outcomes.
    - Execution means actively seeking effective methods rather than passively reporting on work:
        - Before starting, plan in detail how to achieve work objectives.
        - Confirm that tasks will be completed within the agreed deadlines.
        - If delays are expected, immediately identify the fastest solution.
    - In many companies, the “how” of achieving goals is left entirely to employees with minimal managerial intervention.
- **Agile Work Management Template – Method 1: Backward Planning**
    
    
    | Work Schedule | Deadline | Owner | Status | Bottlenecks | Proposed Solution |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | … |  |  |  |  |  |
    | Final Goal |  |  |  |  |  |
    - Begin planning from the ultimate objective and work backwards.
        - This method allows the organization to focus on the end goal.
        - Team members can think through the necessary subtasks step by step and realistically estimate the time and resources required.
        - Backward planning helps identify potential risks in advance and preemptively mitigate them.
    - Work objectives should be expressed in the SMART format:
        - Specific
        - Measurable
        - Achievable
        - Realistic
        - Time-bound
- **Agile Work Management Template – Method 2: Ownership-Based Collaboration**
    - Clearly delineate the tasks needed to achieve a “shared goal” and assign ownership to ensure accountability.
    - Ownership-based collaboration is reinforced during weekly progress meetings, where the designated owners from all departments discuss the status of their tasks.
    - The process is centered on collective effort, with each owner working with their counterparts to achieve a common goal.
    - Regular monitoring helps identify issues that might derail goal achievement, serving as a proactive tool for problem prevention.
- **Weekly Meetings: Anticipating and Preventing Problems**
    - Weekly meetings are used not merely as a passive report of accomplishments but as proactive sessions to identify and resolve potential issues obstructing progress.
    - Tools such as a “traffic light” system provide an overview of progress at a glance.
    - If an issue is foreseen, the responsible person briefly notes the bottleneck in the “Bottlenecks” column and outlines a resolution (who, what, and by when) in the “Proposed Solution” column to be discussed during the meeting.
    - In cases where external collaborators delay work, the leader may escalate the issue to the superior of the responsible party—escalation being aimed at early resolution rather than punishment.
- **Points to Note When Implementing an Agile Process:**
    - Pilot the process organization-wide for about three months before full implementation.
    - It is vital that both senior management and team leaders fully understand how to utilize this agile template and conduct agile meetings.
    - Appoint a responsible individual (preferably at the product leader level) to:
        - Lead the session on backward planning using the work management template with the team.
        - Oversee the updating of progress by each work owner on a weekly basis.
        - Ensure that decisions made during meetings are implemented.
    - Utilize a collaborative documentation tool that allows all work owners to contribute simultaneously.
    - Schedule weekly progress review meetings at a consistent day and time.
    - **The Role of the Leader:**
        - Continuous participation by the leader is essential.
        - Leaders must understand the root causes of any work bottlenecks and actively support the proposed solutions by the team.
    - **The Weekly Meeting Process:**
        - The appointed individual circulates the updated agile management document to all meeting attendees.
        - Every participant, including the leader, reviews the document individually.
        - After review, the leader poses follow-up questions on unclear or critical points.
        - The leader then addresses each “RED” or “YELLOW” task, establishing who will do what by when to restore the status to “GREEN.”
        - If an owner indicates that they cannot resolve an issue by the assigned deadline, a new resolution deadline (DFD: Date For Date) must be agreed upon and monitored.
    - **Additional Considerations for Agile Work Management:**
        - When planning backwards, ensure that tasks are broken down into manageable milestones that allow progress checks within one to two weeks.
        - For the traffic light system, provide internal training so that every team member correctly understands the meaning of “GREEN,” “YELLOW,” or “RED.”
        - Do not penalize owners for “YELLOW” or “RED” statuses; the system is intended for problem identification, not punitive measures.
        - Every subtask’s deadline must be clearly defined; if an exact deadline cannot be set, use a provisional DFD instead.
        - Designate the actual executor as the owner of each task rather than a manager who does not perform the work.
    - **Maximizing a Company’s ROI through Process Utilization:**
        - By providing detailed “data” on work plans, resource requirements, and expected outcomes, processes enable companies to allocate resources efficiently and prioritize projects dynamically.
        - Decisions regarding resource reallocation should consider trade-off impacts to ensure the best output.
        - Even managing a backlog of tasks should factor in trade-off impacts.

# Chapter 4. SOP for Cultivating an Enterprising Organizational Culture

- **The True Meaning and Power of Organizational Culture**
    - Discussions about organizational culture rarely delve deeply into what kind of culture is truly sought, the specific objectives it aims to achieve, and why those objectives matter—often, culture is approached with a vague expectation of a positive work environment rather than as a measurable outcome.
    - Organizational culture cannot be built solely through superficial measures like welfare policies.
    - It is determined by the core values and directional focus of the organization.
    - Even horizontal organizational structures have similar limitations, as the absence of formal titles does not preclude a hierarchy where superiors still direct tasks to subordinates.
    - The goal of organizational culture is internal alignment:
        - To create a unified identity that bonds the team.
        - To enhance cohesion and collective strength through this shared identity.
    - In organizations where internal alignment is lacking, employees tend to pull in different directions, resulting in fragmentation.
    - A unified organization built on a common identity can respond with agility and strength in any situation.
- **Characteristics of a Process-Centric Organizational Culture**
    - Silicon Valley companies focus on cultivating a culture where individual values and beliefs are respected while simultaneously engendering voluntary commitment toward common goals and vision.
    - They identify and recruit individuals with an enterprising nature who can rapidly assimilate the company’s identity and embrace the common purpose of being customer-centric.
    - Organizations composed of employees with inherent ownership will naturally exhibit explosive unity and cohesion when working toward shared objectives.
- **Hiring “Owners” Rather Than Mere Employees**
    - In dynamic, high-autonomy environments such as startups, significant differences in personality and aptitude naturally emerge between employees who can operate in an enterprising manner and those who cannot.
    - Recognizing these differences and recruiting talent whose personality aligns with the organization’s culture is paramount in building a robust culture.
    - Without clear definitions of the type of talent that reflects the company’s values and desired behavior, recruitment becomes highly inefficient in terms of cost and ROI.
    - Common concerns among startup executives include:
        1. How can employees with a passive attitude be coached and managed to work proactively?
        2. How can a startup—often at the weaker end in labor relations or in the job market—unify its organization toward a common direction?
        3. How can one recruit candidates who are naturally aligned with an enterprising organizational culture?
    - One of the biggest obstacles is that candidates with strong ownership and a proactive work attitude are relatively rare.
    - Companies must regularly utilize hiring processes based on Behavioral Event Interviews (BEI) to identify proactive candidates over an extended period.
    - It is advisable to plan early in the year by mapping out a future organizational chart and identifying the roles needed within teams, so that even if a candidate does not immediately accept an offer, relationships can be built and maintained over time.
- **Standards for Verifying Both Competence and Values: Leadership Principles**
    - **Behavioral Interviewing**
        - Rather than inquiring about past performance per se, the focus is on objectively analyzing patterns of behavior to determine whether a candidate’s work style aligns with the company’s criteria.
    - Amazon, for instance, transparently publishes the following leadership principles on its website:
        - These 16 principles are detailed on the hiring page, accompanied by descriptions of how behavioral interviews are conducted based on these principles, including the typical types of questions candidates may face.
        - **Behavioral Codes:**
            1. **Customer Obsession:** Demonstrate through past examples how you proactively resolved customer issues to deliver the ultimate experience.
            2. **Ownership:** Explain how you have taken personal responsibility in resolving problems.
            3. **Invent and Simplify:** Illustrate moments when you resolved a problem creatively by simplifying complex issues.
            4. **Being Right:** Provide examples of how you gathered diverse opinions and objective data to arrive at a correct decision.
            5. **Learn and Be Curious:** Show how acquiring new knowledge led to problem resolution in your past roles.
            6. **Hire and Develop the Best:** For managerial roles, describe how you have actively recruited and nurtured top talent.
            7. **Insist on the Highest Standards:** Share instances when your commitment to quality elevated the output.
            8. **Think Big:** Describe situations where thinking beyond your immediate responsibilities led to innovative solutions.
            9. **Dive Deep:** Provide examples of how you identified root causes in complex problems and resolved them fundamentally.
            10. **Deliver Results:** Explain how your efforts culminated in significant, tangible results.
    - Establishing a hiring process that evaluates past behavior patterns is the first step toward building a successful organizational culture.
- **Behavioral Event Interviews to Gauge Past Patterns**
    - At Amazon, for example:
        - Interviews are conducted one-on-one with 4–8 interviewers, lasting about an hour.
        - A total of 10–12 leadership attributes are evaluated by 5–6 interviewers.
        - This approach gathers sufficient objective information on the candidate’s behavioral patterns.
    - It requires sophisticated interviewing skills to objectively analyze past behavior; relying solely on resumes or performance metrics risks faulty hires.
    - The approach involves:
        - Clearly defining the type of candidate that best fits the organizational culture, using situational criteria to set objective standards.
        - Developing numerous sample questions and a comprehensive hiring manual.
        - Conducting mock interviews to ensure interviewers are thoroughly familiar with the BEI method.
        - Whenever possible, interviews should be one-on-one to avoid group bias.
        - In the debriefing stage, interviewers share and discuss feedback on the candidate’s behavioral patterns and establish internal protocols for final hiring decisions.
        - It is also the company’s responsibility to prepare candidates by explaining core values and expected behaviors, so that candidates can self-assess their fit.
            
            The following interview is designed to understand specific instances in which the candidate demonstrated the core values of our company. The interviewer will select two of our core values and ask the candidate to describe related past experiences.
            
            Please answer using the STAR format:
            
            - **Situation:** Describe the context.
            - **Task:** Explain the task at hand.
            - **Action:** Detail the actions you took.
            - **Results:** Describe the outcome.
            
            Our core values include:
            
            ### Core Values
            
            | Commitment | Understands objectives clearly and immerses in work with passion |
            | --- | --- |
            | Communication | Values diverse perspectives and bases opinions on data and logic. |
            | Teamwork | Prioritizes team success over individual gain through supportive collaboration. |
            | Excellence | Executes responsibilities flawlessly and motivates colleagues through high standards. |
        - Demonstrating alignment with 10–12 behavioral categories in line with the company’s core values is a significant challenge.
- **One Unifying Purpose for Building a Solid Culture: “Customer-Centricity”**
    - As used at CIA, the RICE model explains the core motivators behind human behavior:
        - One of these four—most notably, the belief in a cause greater than oneself (ideology)—acts as a powerful motivator for everyone.
    - In many companies, motivation is largely based on rewards (salary increases and bonuses) and ego (evaluations and promotions).
    - Silicon Valley companies, however, leverage ideology as a core element of their cultural foundation—specifically, an unwavering customer-centric purpose that drives all activities.
    - Customer centricity remains the eternal identity of an organization regardless of circumstance.
    - Companies that merely chase revenue without instilling a unifying purpose in their employees tend to struggle with internal alignment and robust culture.
    - When an enterprise defines its raison d’être solely by specific products or services rather than a customer-centric philosophy, it risks incurring fissures in its culture amid market changes.
    - A shared customer-centric purpose serves as a powerful motivator for employees.
    - Organizations that implement customer centricity tend to make swift and efficient decisions.
    - **Process to Build a Customer-Centric Organization:**
        - The strongest force for internal cohesion is an unshakeable identity built around “for the customer.”
        - While many companies view customer engagement as merely increasing touchpoints or reflecting customer feedback in operations, Silicon Valley firms embed customer centricity in every process, requiring bold, transformative actions.

        - At Amazon, standardized work templates ensure that every employee thinks customer-centrically and incorporates this value into their work.
            - This is exemplified by the internal product planning process (PR/FAQ).
        - They also design hiring and evaluation processes based on core values.
        - When all operational systems are built on specific values, the organization naturally internalizes those values.
        - Creating and cementing a strong organizational culture begins with redesigning fundamental operational processes—a “hard process”—to facilitate fair evaluation.
- **SOP for Fair Evaluations**
    - Most Silicon Valley tech companies supplement their year-end performance review with ongoing performance assessments throughout the year.
        1. A year-end review tied to compensation.
        2. Ongoing career evaluations focused on individual capabilities and performance improvement.
    - Continuous feedback is essential to develop employee capabilities and improve performance.
    - A major drawback of ongoing evaluations is that a direct supervisor is rarely an expert career coach; they are often too busy to dedicate themselves fully to nurturing their subordinates’ career development.
    - It is problematic for someone responsible for salary decisions to also determine how an employee should improve.
    - Separating career coaching from the year-end evaluator:
        - This separation can help prevent bias and ensure fair promotions and compensation.
    - Significant investment in professional coaching and mentoring is required to truly enhance employee performance.
    - Should managers be entirely removed from year-end reviews?
    - **The Morningstar Example:**
        - Known for having no middle management, Morningstar employs self-assessment.
        - Employees conduct self-reviews alongside 360-degree feedback from peers, documenting their achievements and setting their own salary increase and bonus expectations to be submitted to an evaluation committee.
        - The committee then reviews the self-assessments, verifies facts, and discusses an appropriate level of compensation relative to performance.
        - There is a clear mission defined at the company, department, team, and individual levels to align personal work goals with the overall corporate objectives.
        - Notably, everything is aligned to a “customer-centric” focus.
        - Operating with a steadfast North Star goal reflects Jeff Bezos’s management philosophy, and Morningstar’s operations are analogous to Google’s OKR (Objectives and Key Results) system—with the key distinction that Morningstar aligns its mission permanently across the organization, allowing employees to set annual goals within that framework.
        - In contrast, companies using OKRs must continually recalibrate departmental and individual priorities as overall priorities shift.
        - Additionally, Morningstar’s self-assessment emphasizes the value created rather than the mere completion of objectives.
        - The existence of an independent evaluation committee is intended to counteract inherent individual biases.
    - To objectively evaluate the value created, ideally every employee’s performance should be converted into a common metric—but this is exceptionally challenging.
        - However, if each role’s expected competencies and results are transparently shared and measurable, a more equitable performance management process can be established.
- **Methods for Implementing Self-Evaluation**
    - An example of an attempt to adopt OKRs was abandoned when it was found that employees did not know how to set proper work objectives.
    - Rather than focusing solely on the “value” an employee creates, many set arbitrary targets for the sake of targets.
    - Establishing a North Star goal—a long-term, aspirational target that defines the ultimate, albeit challenging, customer experience—is most desirable.
    - **A Goal-Centric Work Culture:**
        - In such a culture, employees are not confined to narrowly defined roles (R&R), but proactively work toward the North Star goal, fully aware of the value they create.
        - This environment fulfills the three essential ingredients—autonomy, purpose, and mastery—outlined in Daniel Pink’s book *Drive* as prerequisites for peak performance and fulfillment.

# Chapter 5. What Leaders Must Know When Designing Success Through Process

- **Amazon’s Optimized Balance Between People-Driven and Process-Driven Management**
    - (X) An entirely autonomous culture that relies solely on people
    - (X) An overly bureaucratic, process-obsessed management
    - (O) Selecting accountable work owners and empowering them with proven processes that foster autonomy and high performance
- **The Downsides of an Overly People-Centric Approach:**
    - Excessive reliance on individuals
    - The company’s stability becomes vulnerable to the presence or absence of key talent
- **The Downsides of an Overly Process-Centric Approach:**
    
    > “Good processes enable a company to provide better service to its customers. However, if not managed carefully, the process itself can become the problem—a situation that can easily arise in large organizations when the process becomes a proxy for the desired outcome.” – Jeff Bezos
    > 
    - This can lead to a situation where one loses sight of the bigger picture by focusing solely on rigid adherence to process.
    - When outcomes are neglected in favor of merely following the process, its original purpose is lost.
- **The Devil is in the Details**
- **The Effectiveness of a Process Depends on the Leader’s Resolve:**
    - If a process is adopted, it must be rigorously followed by everyone in the organization—leaders included—to ensure there are no “leaks in the system.”
    - The benefits of a process are realized only when every organizational member participates actively and continuously.
    - When leadership neglects to adhere to the process, significant risks arise, including the possibility of a non-visionary CEO classifying themselves as exceptions, thereby undermining the entire process.
