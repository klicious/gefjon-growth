In a nutshell: Drawing on proven hiring science—structured interviews, targeted work-sample tests, and rubric-based scoring—we can build a seven-stage process that screens for the rare blend of backend depth, quantitative rigor, trading-domain intuition, and crisp communication your Platform Development Team needs. Below you’ll find (1) the research principles behind the process, (2) a stage-by-stage plan with owners, timing, and pass criteria, (3) fresh question banks, (4) a ready-to-read company-and-team intro script, (5) extra competencies to watch for, (6) a scoring rubric template, and (7) tactics to keep every candidate raving about the experience.

1. What the research says
	•	Structured > ad-hoc. Google’s re:Work data show that standardised questions plus anchored grading raise predictive validity dramatically and reduce bias.  ￼
	•	Meta-analysis finds structured interviews up to 40 % more predictive than unstructured chats.  ￼
	•	Work-sample tests (e.g., a bounded take-home or live pair-programming exercise) are the single best predictor of on-the-job performance for engineers.  ￼
	•	Poorly scoped take-homes hurt brand and fairness; CoderPad recommends ≤ 120 min scope and real-world problems.  ￼
	•	Clear rubrics improve equity and signal quality.  ￼
	•	Great candidate experience boosts offer-accept rates and retention.  ￼
	•	Quant-finance interviews lean heavier on math brain-teasers, low-latency design, and concurrency than generic SWE loops.  ￼ ￼
	•	Modern loops increasingly pair AI screeners with human panels; FT cautions to keep human judgment in the loop.  ￼
	•	Excessive multi-day tasks and down-levelling damage employer reputation.  ￼ ￼

2. Proposed multi-stage interview flow

Stage	Purpose & Focus	Duration	Evaluators	Pass / Fail Signals
0. Structured Resume Screen	Minimum bar on tech stack, quant coursework, domain hints.	10 min	HR + Hiring Mgr	Must meet 80 % of must-have skills.
1. Recruiter Connect	Motivation, logistics, core-values primer.	30 min	Sr. Tech Recruiter	Clear articulation of why crypto-fintech & ownership examples.
2. Technical Phone Screen (live coding)	Algorithms + code quality in shared editor.	60 min	Sr. Backend Eng	Clean, idiomatic Python; O(log n) or better; tests.
3. Take-Home Work-Sample (capped 4 hrs)	Build a minimal market-data ingestor & REST endpoint (Python or Java).	4 hrs async	Candidate solo, rubric scored by two reviewers	Functional completeness ≥ 80 %; CodeClimate ≥ B; README with runbook.
4. Virtual On-Site Loop (½ day)	① System design (low-latency trading service) • ② Quant/problem-solving (P&L reconciler maths) • ③ Pair-programming debug • ④ Behavioral/values.	4 × 60 min	Eng Mgr, Quant Dev, SRE, Peer	See rubric §6.
5. Exec / Leadership Chat	Vision, growth path, culture add.	45 min	Head of Platform	Strategic thinking; learning mindset.
6. Reference & Offer Review	Validate ownership, integrity; present comp.	30 min	Recruiter + CTO	≥ 2 strong references.

All interviewers score on a 1–5 scale against explicit criteria; hiring committee makes final call, not any single interviewer (inspired by Google’s model).  ￼

3. Fresh question banks

3.1 Behavioral (values-anchored)

Theme	Sample Question	What Good Looks Like
Ownership & Proactivity	“Tell me about the last Sev-0 you owned end-to-end. How did you page yourself, run the RCA, and harden the fix within 24 h?”	Mentions on-call, metric alerts, documented RCA, follow-up PRs.
Data-Informed Iteration	“Walk through a feature where A/B telemetry changed the rollout decision.”	Cites KPI uplift, experiment design.
Safety > Quality > Speed	“Describe a time you slowed a release for a guard-rail.”	Demonstrates risk calculus.

3.2 Technical coding / design
	•	Live coding: merge-k-sorted-streams (tests + Big-O discussion) – reflects market-data stitching.
	•	Design: “Design a real-time order-book service that fans out 5 k updates/s with < 5 ms p99-latency; plan horizontal scaling.” (Inspired by DDIA prep approach)  ￼
	•	Debug pairing: trace & fix a Python asyncio race causing missed WebSocket messages.

3.3 Quantitative & logical

Type	Example
Math brain-teaser	“Angle between hour and minute hands at 12:15?” (52.5°)  ￼
Probability	“Expected time to fill if arrival rate λ = 12 ticks/s and fill prob = 0.2 per tick?”
Logical deduction	Classic bridge-crossing; assess concise reasoning.  ￼

3.4 Multi-agent / AI
	•	“Explain the A2A (agent-to-agent) pattern you’d use to let a code-gen agent hand off tests to a monitoring agent; where do dead-letter queues fit?” (base on latest MAS practices)  ￼

4. Company & Platform Team intro script (≈ 3 min)

“Welcome! I’ll start with a quick panorama so you have context for every question we’ll ask.
Mission – Engineer cross-region, self-healing fintech platforms that move capital instantly while guaranteeing systemic safety.
Vision – Global benchmark for real-time observability and < 5 min MTTR.
Core values – Technical Excellence, Customer-Centricity, Ownership, Observability, Data-driven iteration, Integrity, Security, Collaboration, Continuous Learning, Innovation. We make them real with SLO burn-rates, immutable audit logs, and weekly kill-switch drills.
What the Platform Team does – algo trading across 27 instruments, real-time PMS, multi-agent automation, live docs, DevOps/SRE, and mentorship.
Committed work for Q3/Q4 ’25 – Agent v2 Autopilot, Live-Docs vNext, eBPF observability, LLM FinOps optimizer, Enfusion cut-over, hiring spurts.
Tech stack – Python 3.12, Spring Boot 3, PostgreSQL, Redis Streams, AWS ECS, GitLab CI, OpenAI o3 & friends.
Culture – Safety > Quality > Speed > Novelty, “scalable elegance,” heavy Domain-Driven Design, blameless RCAs.
H1 ’25 wins – 99.7 % quote capture, $0.5 M rebate / mo, multi-agent PRs with < 5 % reverts.
Challenges we’re tackling – latency scaling, GPU FinOps, agent change-approval.
Roadmap – Zero-Ops desk, cross-asset expansion, AI-native SDLC.
*Feel free to ask us anything along the way—interviews are two-way.”

5. Additional critical skills to surface

Skill	Why it matters	Elicitation method
Low-latency tuning	Market-making P&L is extremely tail-latency sensitive.	System-design deep-dive, flame-graph debug scenario.
Concurrency primitives	Mitigate order-book races.	Coding Q on lock-free hash tables.  ￼
Numerical stability / floating-point hygiene	P&L accrual accuracy.	Whiteboard: sum tiny fees vs big notionals.
Event-sourcing mindset	Future PMS 2.0 ledger.	Ask design trade-offs between CRUD & append-only.
Cost-aware LLM orchestration	Agent v2 needs price-latency trade-offs.	Scenario: choose OpenAI vs local Ollama under SLA.

6. Evaluation rubric (illustrative excerpt)

Criterion	Weight	5 – Exceptional	3 – Meets	1 – Below
Functional completeness	25 %	All spec cases incl. edge feeds; deploy script	Core paths only	Fails major case
Code quality & elegance	20 %	Clean DDD modules, 0 lint warnings	Minor style nits	Spaghetti
Quant reasoning	15 %	Derives formula & explains limits	Correct answer only	Guesswork
System design	15 %	Scales 10×, observability baked-in	OK for current load	Misses bottleneck
Communication	10 %	Crisp, structured, questions assumptions	Understandable	Rambling
Ownership signals	10 %	Mentions self-paging, RCAs, docs	Takes responsibility	Blames others
Culture add	5 %	Proposes new value-aligned practice	Resonates	Misaligned

Each interviewer rates independently; hiring committee reviews spread and evidence snippets. Use Frame-of-Reference calibration training before loops to sync on scoring anchors (proven to cut bias).  ￼

7. Crafting a five-star candidate experience
	•	Time-bounded tasks & optional paid option for the take-home (respecting concerns about free labour).  ￼
	•	Single-day virtual loop to reduce context switching and scheduling fatigue.
	•	Pre-brief & de-brief: share agenda, prepare environment (SDK, IDE), send feedback within 48 h.
	•	Interviewer training on micro-aggressions & inclusive cues (camera angles, pronounce names).
	•	Swag / follow-up: send anonymised trading-sim dataset so candidates can keep learning.
	•	Ask-us-anything Slack window between offer and decision to deepen engagement.

⸻

Next steps
	1.	Review stage definitions with HR & legal.
	2.	Build the calibrated scoring sheets in Greenhouse / Lever.
	3.	Pilot with two back-fill roles, gather metric deltas on pass-through & time-to-hire.
	4.	Iterate every quarter using candidate NPS and hiring-committee precision.
