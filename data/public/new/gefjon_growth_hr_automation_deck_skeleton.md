## Slide 3: Vision & Purpose

- **Vision**: Build an end‑to‑end HR automation platform that delivers intelligent decision support for talent acquisition and beyond.
- **Core principles**
- **Automation with human oversight**: automate repetitive tasks while maintaining critical human checkpoints.
- **Context engineering**: load all relevant data first, verify completeness, and validate outputs.
- **Scalability & customization**: design a modular architecture that can be adapted for different clients and future HR functions.
- **Current focus**: Hiring pipeline automation using our own hiring process as the proof of concept.

## Slide 4: Problem & Opportunity

- **Pain points in traditional hiring**
- Manual screening and interview preparation consume significant recruiter time.
- Inconsistent evaluation criteria lead to variability in candidate quality and potential bias.
- Scaling hiring without proportionally increasing staffing is difficult.
- **Opportunity**
- Automate repetitive and low‑value tasks (data intake, screening, assignment generation) to free recruiter capacity.
- Provide evidence‑based evaluations to improve hiring quality and reduce bias.
- Use data to continuously improve processes and inform broader HR functions.

## Slide 5: Solution Overview

- **High‑level workflow**: A 7‑stage pipeline that ingests candidate data, validates context, normalizes profiles, screens candidates, generates assignments, prepares interview kits, and consolidates results.
- **Context‑centric AI**: All agents load complete context before acting, verify existing artifacts, and ensure information completeness.
- **Scalable architecture**: Built on Python ≥ 3.12, Gemini CLI with ReAct methodology, UV package management, DVC for data versioning, and Git for version control.
- **Outcome**: A production‑ready pipeline that automates hiring from résumé intake to final candidate evaluation.

## Slide 6: Technical Architecture

- **Core technology stack**
- Language: **Python ≥ 3.12** with modern package management (UV).
- AI framework: **Gemini CLI using ReAct methodology** (reason → act → observe → repeat).

## Slide 8: Workflow Stages (Detail)

- **Stage 0 – Pre‑Flight Validation**
- Verify environment, context completeness (≥90%), and setup logs.
- **Stage 1 – Context Load & Verification**
- Discover context files, validate schemas, and identify missing information.
- **Stage 2 – Intake & Normalization**
- Consolidate candidate data into a single JSON, codify candidate IDs, assess data quality (≥80%).
- **Stage 3 – JD Mapping & Competency Alignment**
- Parse job descriptions, run skills gap analysis (≥75% confidence), and validate experience levels.
- **Stage 4 – Automated Screening**
- Score candidates on multiple dimensions; apply bias detection; classify into strong hire, hire, lean hire, or no hire.
- **Stage 5 – Take‑Home Assignment Generation**
- Generate personalized assignments for candidates scoring ≥ 8.0/10, calibrated for difficulty and relevance.
- **Stage 6 – Interview Kit Generation**
- Create behavioral event interview (BEI) kits: candidate briefs, value gap analyses, guides, and scripts using STAR questions.
- **Stage 7 – Consolidation & Final Organization**
- Assemble all outputs, create summary reports, organize directories, and produce audit logs.

## Slide 9: Data Flow & Artifacts

- **Input format**
- Single JSON file (json) containing an array of candidate profiles: personal details, skills, work experience, education, core values alignment, and GitHub metrics.
- **Output structure**
- Organized in artifacts/public/hiring/candidates/20250811_consolidated/{candidate_id}_{normalized_name}/.
- Each candidate directory contains subfolders for screening reports, take‑home assignments, interview kits (md, interview_guide.md, interview_script.md), evaluation frameworks, communication templates, and summary reports.
- **Example**
- For candidate atlas_001_minseok_kim: screening score 9.1/10 (strong hire); assignment on infrastructure automation; full BEI interview kit; comprehensive evaluation framework.

## Slide 10: Unique Differentiators

- **Context engineering approach**: ensures all relevant data is loaded and verified before decisions are made.
