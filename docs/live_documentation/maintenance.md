# Gefjon Growth: Maintenance & Operations

## Monitoring

*   **AI Workflow Execution Logs**: Monitor logs generated by the Gemini CLI for successful execution of prompts, any errors during AI processing, or issues with data handling.
*   **File System Monitoring**: Ensure that input files are being processed and output files are being generated correctly in the `artifacts/` directory.
*   **Resource Utilization**: Monitor CPU and memory usage during AI processing, especially for large batches of candidate data.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Prompt Execution Failures**: Check the Gemini CLI output for specific error messages. Verify the syntax of prompts and the availability of required context files.
*   **Incorrect Output Generation**: Review the generated interview materials against the input data and expected outcomes. Adjust prompts or context data as necessary.
*   **File System Access Issues**: Ensure the application has appropriate read/write permissions for the `data/` and `artifacts/` directories.

## Deployment & Rollback

*   **Deployment**: Deploy new versions by updating the Python codebase and ensuring all dependencies are met. If running in a containerized environment, rebuild and redeploy the Docker image.
*   **Rollback**: In case of critical issues with a new deployment, revert to a previous stable version by deploying the older codebase or Docker image.

## Backup & Recovery

*   **Context Data Backup**: Regularly back up the `context/` directory, which contains critical company information and HR processes.
*   **Prompt & Plan Backup**: Ensure the `ai_docs/` directory, containing prompts and plans, is version-controlled and backed up.
*   **Generated Artifacts**: While generated artifacts can be re-created, consider backing up critical or sensitive interview materials from `artifacts/private/`.
