This document describes the interfaces for the Gefjon-Growth project.

## Gemini CLI

The primary interface to this project is the Gemini CLI. The project is structured to be used with the `gemini` command-line tool, which allows you to run AI agents, manage context, and generate artifacts.

## Configuration

The project is configured through a set of YAML files in the `context` directory, as well as the `.gemini/GEMINI.md` and `.gemini/tools.yaml` files.

## File System

The project's directory structure is a key part of its interface. The `data` directory is used for input data, the `artifacts` directory is for generated output, and the `scripts` directory is for helper scripts.
