# Gefjon-Growth Maintenance

This document provides instructions for maintaining the Gefjon-Growth project.

## Updating the Template

As the Gemini CLI and best practices for AI development evolve, this template should be updated to reflect those changes. This includes updating the directory structure, configuration files, and documentation.

## Prompt Engineering

Continuously refine the prompts in the `.gemini/prompts` directory to improve the performance of the AI agents.

## Tooling

Keep the tools defined in `.gemini/tools.yaml` up-to-date and add new tools as needed.
