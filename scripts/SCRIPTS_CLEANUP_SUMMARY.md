## 🎯 Primary Scripts (Production Ready)

### Master Integration
- **complete_workflow_final.py** - Complete workflow execution with verification
  - Runs all components in correct order
  - Verifies completeness and consistency
  - Single command for full workflow

### Core Components  
- **consolidate_hiring_results.py** - Organize scattered results into candidate directories
- **generate_enhanced_materials.py** - Generate comprehensive materials for all candidates
- **generate_overall_summary.py** - Create executive summaries and reports
- **verify_workflow_consistency.py** - Verify workflow matches implementation

### Utilities
- **split_candidates.py** - Process and normalize candidate data
- **validate_hr_context.py** - Validate HR context and configuration

## 📦 Archived Scripts (8 scripts)

### Superseded Scripts
- **complete_workflow_integration.py** → Replaced by `complete_workflow_final.py`
- **generate_complete_candidate_materials.py** → Replaced by `generate_enhanced_materials.py`

### Development Scripts
- **update_workflow_to_match_reality.py** → Development-only script
- **generate_complete_materials_enhanced.py** → Incomplete implementation

### One-Time Use Scripts
- **cleanup_workflow_files.py** → Used for initial workflow cleanup
- **verify_workflow_cleanup.py** → Used for workflow verification
- **cleanup_scripts_directory.py** → Used for scripts cleanup
- **verify_clean_setup.py** → Used for setup verification

## 🚀 Usage for Future Agents

### Complete Workflow Execution
```bash
python scripts/complete_workflow_final.py
```

### Individual Components
```bash
# Step 1: Consolidate results
python scripts/consolidate_hiring_results.py

# Step 2: Generate materials  
python scripts/generate_enhanced_materials.py

# Step 3: Generate summary
python scripts/generate_overall_summary.py

# Step 4: Verify consistency
python scripts/verify_workflow_consistency.py
```
